00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,179
Hi, my name's Mark. I'm here to see Bigoted Bill.

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:16,759
Okay, but just so you know, Bill can be sexist, ablest, racist and generaly bigoted.

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:17,839
But it's best to hear him out.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,780
Did someone say Bill?

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Take a seat.

6
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,579

00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,059
Ah..

10
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:26,559
Don't care.

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,099
You'll fit in quite good I reckon, But first you need...

00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,200
Hey, wait a second

Back to where I came from... My work.

Beat the traffic it'll be berserk!

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,700
Bigoted, Bigoted, Bigoted Bill!

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,340
Lunch is at twelve, you get one hour, The washroom's here if you need a shower.

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,129
We're the best company on the planet, Oh my god have you seen Janet?

20
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:57,728
Oh my god I love her to bits, Sheâ€™s got a great, pair, of...

21
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,939
Double degrees, she's above the rest! Business and law, she's the best!

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,240
Bigoted, Bigoted, Bigoted Bill!

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,719
And that guy there, he loves poofs!

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Have you met Jerry? He's aloof!

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,780

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,739

Bigoted, Bigoted, Bigoted Bill!

30
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,500
God I hate his handicap.

31
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,620
If mine was that low, I'd be wrapped!

32
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,660
I was talking 'bout golf, you see! Not talkin' 'bout his disability!

33
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,959
Bigoted, Bigoted, Bigoted Bill!

34
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,179
And did I mention I beat women?

35
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,240
*awks as fuck silence*

36
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,319
To the picket line, to fight for their rights!

37
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,459
Treating women bad is a joke, Because you can be a feminist and a bloke!

38
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,459
Bigoted, Bigoted, Bigoted Bill!

39
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,658
Wow Bill, it seems I was the one who was wrong,

40
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:54,659
I thought you'd be sexist, ablest, and racist just because your name is Bigoted Bill!

41
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,350
Oh you silly boy I'm regular Bill, y'see? Bigoted Bill is over there

Bigoted Bill is a nasty man I don't know why he works here

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
*flappy sound of a racist man waving politely*
