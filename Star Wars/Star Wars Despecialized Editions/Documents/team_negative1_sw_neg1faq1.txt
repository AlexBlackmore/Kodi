Star Wars - 35mm LPP Silver screen version  FAQ v1.0b
===========================================================
Welcome, from Team Negative1 to our FAQ for our release of
Star Wars 35mm Silver Screen version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE : We will not be replying to any technical issues, such as burning
discs, or playback. Please refer to the Technical forums on OriginalTrilogy.com

Similarily, any requests for color changes or corrections will have to
be done on your own. Our choices are presented as a reference.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our philosophy was to restore the print back to what it would have been viewed like
theatrically. It is not a pristine cleaned version. We have cleaned major dust and dirt,
stabilized, deflickered, and color corrected it. It is also cropped theatrically, 
although there is slightly more image in the original scans which was not intended
to be viewed in the theater.

Source information and Details
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q : What is this sourced from?
A : This version is a digital recreation of Star Wars sourced from different 35mm prints.

Q : What was used from which print?
A : The primary source was a Spanish 35 mm LPP print.
    The intro and crawl were from a faded English Eastman Kodak print. (Does not have Episode 4 in it)
    The Han shoots first scene was sourced from a faded Eastman Kodak print.
    There are also several replacement shots throughout the movie from faded Eastman Kodak prints.

Q : What was it scanned at?
A : The majority of it was taken from 2k scans, but some sections were scanned in 4k,
    and downsampled to 2k.

Q : What is an LPP print.
A : It is a type of print that is Low fade Positive Print, and retains colors better than
    the Eastman Kodak types that fade.

Q : Some shots look blurry and lower resolution?
A : Any shot with effects will have lower resolution, due to multiple copies for that process.

Q : There are dirt and some shots with marks on them?
A : For our restoration, we chose to leave original marks, matte lines, and boxes in the film.
    So keep an eye out for those, along with the reel change marks.

Q : The bluray has more detail.
A : Yes, the scans of these prints, will never be able to match that clarity due to multiple
    process used to produce a release print. However, many scenes are still as sharp or sharper.

Q : How authentic are the colors.
A : Although not a Technicolor, which is a different process. This version accurately matches
    the colors of the print if it were being projected. We have compared this with projected versions,
    and the match is fairly close. Shots were color corrected scene by scene in a lot of the film.

Q : How long did it take to do this?
A : The project started 7 years ago, but 4 years is when the bulk of the work was done. With
    the fine tuning and quality checks in the last year.

Q : How many releases are there?
A : Currently we have 1 MKV 1080p 2 Bluray 1080p ISO file versions. There may be more
    downconverts, and a few updates, on the audio, images, and other items released
    later on. We do not currently have plans for a Grindhouse version of this.

Q : Do I have to pay for this?
A : NO, this is a free fanedit restoration. Just make sure you support Disney, and Lucasfilm.

Q : Where can I find it?
A : Usenet groups, and private trackers like Myspleen.

Grindhouse series (3 releases).
