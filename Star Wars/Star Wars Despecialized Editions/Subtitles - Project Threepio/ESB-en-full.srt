00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:26,642
A long time ago in a galaxy far,
far away....

00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:33,734
STAR
WARS

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Episode V
THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,450
It is a dark time
for the Rebellion.

5
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,000
Although the Death Star
has been destroyed...

6
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,550
...Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces
from their hidden base...

7
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,650
...and pursued them across the galaxy.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,950
Evading the dreaded Imperial Starfleet...

9
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,500
...a group of freedom fighters
led by Luke Skywalker...

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,400
...has established a new secret base
on the remote ice world of Hoth.

11
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:21,320
The evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with
finding young Skywalker...

12
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,420
...has dispatched thousands of remote probes
into the far reaches of space....

13
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,383
Echo Three to Echo Seven.
Han, old buddy, do you read me?

14
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,683
<i>Loud and clear, kid.</i>
<i>What’s up?</i>

15
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:42,522
Well, I finished my circle.
I don’t pick up any life readings.

16
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,658
<i>There isn’t enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.</i>

17
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,395
– <i>Sensors are placed. I’m going back.</i>
– Right. I’ll see you shortly.

18
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:53,898
There’s a meteorite that hit the ground near here.
I want to check it out. It won’t take long.

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,392
Steady, hey, steady, girl.
Hey, what’s the matter?

20
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,072
You smell something?

21
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,781
Chewie! Chewie?
Chewie!

22
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:53,523
All right! Don’t lose your temper.
I’ll come right back and give you a hand.

23
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,878
– Solo.
– No sign of life out there, General.

24
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,485
The sensors are in place. You’ll know
if anything comes around.

25
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,486
Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

26
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,856
No. He’s checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

27
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,727
With all the meteor activity in this system,
it’s going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

28
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,263
– General, I’ve got to leave. I can’t stay anymore.
– I’m sorry to hear that.

29
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:34,962
Well, there’s a price on my head. If I don’t pay off
Jabba the Hutt, I’m a dead man.

30
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:39,834
A death mark’s not an easy thing to live with.
You’re a good fighter, Solo.

31
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,840
– I hate to lose you.
– Thank you, General.

32
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:54,886
– Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.
– That’s right.

33
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:00,152
Well, don’t get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

34
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,992
Han!

35
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:09,102
– Yes, Your Highnessness?
– I thought you had decided to stay.

36
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,171
Well, the bounty hunter we ran into
on Ord Mantell changed my mind.

37
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,330
Han, we need you!

38
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,776
– <i>We</i> need?
– Yes.

39
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,976
– Well, what about <i>you</i> need?
– <i>I</i> need?

40
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:23,045
– I don’t know what you’re talking about.
– You probably don’t.

41
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,619
– And what precisely am I supposed to know?
– Come on!

42
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,988
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

43
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,789
Yes! You’re a great help to us.
You’re a natural leader.

44
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,993
No! That’s not it.
Come on.

45
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:39,021
– A-ha! Come on.
– You’re imagining things.

46
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:41,500
Am I? Then why are you following me?

47
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,870
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

48
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,673
– I’d just as soon kiss a Wookiee!
– I can arrange that.

49
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,964
You could use a good kiss!

50
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,379
Don’t try to blame me. I didn’t ask you to turn on
the thermal heater. I merely commented...

51
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,679
...that it was freezing in the princess’s chamber.

52
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,085
But it’s supposed to be freezing! How we’re going
to dry out all of her clothes, I really don’t know.

53
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,055
Oh, switch off!

54
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,656
Why did you take this apart now?
I’m trying to get us out of here...

55
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:06,493
– ...and you pull both of these—
– Excuse me, sir.

56
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,961
– Put them back together, right now!
– Might I have a word with you, please?

57
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,755
– What do you want?
– Well, it’s Princess Leia, sir. She’s been trying...

58
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:14,567
– ...to get you on the communicator.
– I turned it off. I don’t want to talk to her.

59
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,903
Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.

60
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,905
He hasn’t come back yet.
She doesn’t know where he is.

61
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,940
– I don’t know where he is.
– Nobody knows where he is.

62
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,941
– What do you mean, nobody knows?
– Well, uh, you see—

63
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,178
– Deck Officer! Deck Officer!
– Excuse me, sir, might I—

64
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,381
– Yes, sir?
– Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?

65
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,417
I haven’t seen him. It’s possible
he came in through the south entrance.

66
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:35,288
It’s possible? Why don’t you go find out?
It’s getting dark out there.

67
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,789
Yes, sir.

68
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,891
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what’s going on?

69
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,392
Why not?

70
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,927
Impossible man. Come along, R2,
let’s find Princess Leia.

71
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:46,891
Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

72
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,644
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn’t come in the south entrance.

73
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,280
– He might have forgotten to check in.
– Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

74
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,483
Uh, not yet. We’re having some trouble
adapting them to the cold.

75
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,552
– We’ll have to go out on tauntauns.
– Sir, the temperature’s dropping too rapidly!

76
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,950
That’s right, and my friend’s out in it.

77
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,795
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

78
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,095
Then I’ll see you in Hell!

79
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,486
You must come along now, R2.
There’s really nothing more we can do.

80
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,063
And my joints are freezing up.

81
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,925
Don’t say things like that!
Of course we’ll see Master Luke again.

82
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,437
And he’ll be quite all right.
You’ll see.

83
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,568
Stupid little short circuit.
He’ll be quite all right.

84
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,092
Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no—

85
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,106
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

86
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,300
Mistress Leia, R2 says he’s been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

87
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,149
...although he does admit that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

88
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,449
Your Highness, there’s nothing more we can do
tonight. The shield doors must be closed.

89
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,922
– Close the doors.
– Yes, sir.

90
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:11,787
R2 says the chances of survival are 725 to 1.

91
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,840
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

92
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,040
...from time to time.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

93
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,458
Don’t worry about Master Luke.
I’m sure he’ll be all right.

94
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,049
He’s quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

95
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,200
<i>Luke.</i>

96
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
<i>Luke.</i>

97
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,200
Ben?

98
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:16,691
– <i>You will go to the Dagobah system.</i>
– Dagobah system?

99
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,862
<i>There you will learn from Yoda...</i>

100
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:23,565
<i>...the Jedi master who instructed me.</i>

101
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,467
Ben! Ben!

102
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,612
Luke! Luke!

103
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:47,626
Don’t do this, Luke.
Come on, give me a sign here.

104
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:14,381
– Not much time.
– Ben... Ben...

105
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,990
Hang on, kid.

106
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,051
– Dagobah system.
– Whew!

107
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:29,157
– This may smell bad, kid...
– Yoda.

108
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,301
...but it’ll keep you warm
until I get the shelter built.

109
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:43,243
I thought they smelled bad on the outside!

110
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:31,588
Echo Base, I’ve got something.
Not much, but it could be a life form.

111
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:39,971
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.

112
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:46,237
This is Rogue Two.
Captain Solo, do you copy?

113
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,423
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.

114
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:01,424
<i>Good morning!
Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

115
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:07,295
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.
I’ve found them. Repeat, I’ve found them.

116
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,226
Master Luke, sir, it’s so good
to see you fully functional again.

117
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,636
R2 expresses his relief also.

118
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,934
How ya feelin’, kid?
You don’t look so bad to me.

119
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,441
In fact, you look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

120
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,639
– Thanks to you.
– That’s two you owe me, junior.

121
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:59,249
Well, Your Worship, looks like you managed
to keep me around for a little while longer.

122
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,755
I had nothing to do with it.
General Rieekan thinks it’s dangerous...

123
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,888
...for any ships to leave the system
until we’ve activated the energy field.

124
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:08,761
That’s a good story.
I think you just can’t bear...

125
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,523
...to let a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

126
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,930
I don’t know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

127
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,603
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

128
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:23,441
...but you didn’t see us alone
in the south passage.

129
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,443
– She expressed her true feelings for me.
– My...

130
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,505
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

131
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,382
...scruffy-looking nerf herder!

132
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,852
Who’s scruffy-looking?

133
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:43,291
I must have hit pretty close to the mark
to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?

134
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,024
Well, I guess you don’t know
everything about women yet.

135
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,441
<i>Headquarters personnel,</i>
<i>report to command center.</i>

136
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:04,477
<i>Headquarters personnel,</i>
<i>report to command center.</i>

137
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,051
– Take it easy.
– Excuse us, please.

138
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,623
Princess, we have a visitor.

139
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,229
We’ve picked up something outside
the base’s Zone 12, moving east.

140
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,453
– It’s metal.
– Then it couldn’t be one of those creatures.

141
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:23,426
– Could be a speeder, one of ours.
– No... wait.

142
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,164
There’s something
very weak coming through.

143
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,578
Sir, I’m fluent in six million
forms of communication.

144
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:37,607
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an Imperial code.

145
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,123
It isn’t friendly, whatever it is.
Come on, Chewie, let’s check it out.

146
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,723
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

147
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,364
– <i>Afraid there’s not much left.</i>
– What was it?

148
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,933
<i>Droid of some kind. I didn’t hit it
that hard. Must’ve had a self-destruct.</i>

149
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,895
– An Imperial probe droid.
– <i>It’s a good bet the Empire knows we’re here.</i>

150
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:36,472
We’d better start the evacuation.

151
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:23,654
– Admiral.
– Yes, Captain?

152
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:28,393
I think we’ve got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

153
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,296
...from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it’s the best lead we’ve had.

154
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,459
We have thousands of probe droids searching
the galaxy. I want proof, not leads.

155
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,468
– The visuals indicate life readings.
– It could mean anything.

156
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,100
– If we followed up every lead—
– But sir, the Hoth system...

157
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,243
– ...is supposed to be devoid of human forms.
– You’ve found something?

158
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,343
Yes, my lord.

159
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,945
That’s it.
The rebels are there.

160
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:54,809
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

161
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:57,689
– It could be smugglers, it could be—
– That is the system.

162
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:03,095
And I’m sure Skywalker is with them.
Set your course for the Hoth system.

163
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:07,130
– General Veers, prepare your men.
– Admiral.

164
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,240
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

165
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:20,245
As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation
control will give clearance for immediate launch.

166
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,945
Right, sir.

167
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,476
All right! That’s it.
Try it.

168
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,416
Oh! Turn it off!
Turn it off! Off!

169
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,686
Turn it off!

170
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,430
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

171
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,332
Well, forget the heavy equipment.
There’s plenty of time...

172
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,933
...to get the smaller modules
on the transports.

173
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,333
– Take care, sir.
– Thanks.

174
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,739
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

175
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,246
Okay, okay!

176
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,117
Hi, kid.

177
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,800
There’s got to be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

178
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,987
Wait a second.

179
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:07,022
– You all right?
– Yeah.

180
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:15,701
Be careful.

181
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,564
You too.

182
00:22:23,874 --> 00:22:28,090
General, there’s a fleet of Star Destroyers
coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

183
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,350
Reroute all power to the energy shield.

184
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,390
We’ve got to hold them until
all transports are away.

185
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,543
Prepare for ground assault.

186
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,664
– What is it, General?
– My lord, the fleet has moved out of light speed.

187
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,710
ComScan has detected an energy field protecting
an area of the sixth planet...

188
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,146
...of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

189
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,815
The rebels are alerted to our presence.

190
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,950
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

191
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:11,545
– He... He felt surprise was wiser.
– He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

192
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:16,516
– General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.
– Yes, my lord.

193
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:27,467
<i>Lord Vader. The fleet has moved out of
light speed, and we’re preparing to—</i>

194
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,971
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

195
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:35,947
– Captain Piett.
– <i>Yes, my lord?</i>

196
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,073
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

197
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,143
...and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

198
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,990
– You are in command now, Admiral Piett.
– <i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

199
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,921
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

200
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,966
The heavy transport ships will leave
as soon as they’re loaded.

201
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,266
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

202
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,135
The energy shield can only be opened
for a short time...

203
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:02,571
...so you’ll have to stay very close
to your transports.

204
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:04,941
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

205
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,112
The ion cannon will fire several shots...

206
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,538
...to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

207
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:14,920
When you’ve gotten past the energy shield,
proceed directly to the rendezvous point.

208
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,050
– Understood?
– Yeah.

209
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:21,253
– Good luck.
– Okay. Everybody to your stations. Let’s go!

210
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:43,440
Their primary target will be the
power generators. Prepare to open shield.

211
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:53,649
– Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.
– Good. Our first catch of the day.

212
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
Stand by, ion control.

213
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,597
Fire.

214
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,700
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

215
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,652
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

216
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,190
– Feeling all right, sir?
– Just like new, Dak. How about you?

217
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,357
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

218
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:36,932
I know what you mean.

219
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,917
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.
We’ve spotted Imperial walkers.

220
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:00,789
<i>Imperial walkers on the north ridge.</i>

221
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,381
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We’re on our way.

222
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,647
All right, boys, keep tight now.

223
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,483
– Luke, I have no approach vector. I’m not set.
– Steady, Dak.

224
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,861
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

225
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
All right.
I’m coming in.

226
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,673
Hobbie, you still with me?

227
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,763
That armor’s too strong for blasters.

228
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,336
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

229
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:22,636
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

230
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,101
All right.
Stand by, Dak.

231
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, Luke, we’ve got a malfunction in
fire control. I’ll have to cut in the auxiliary.

232
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:34,845
Just hang on. Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

233
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,425
Dak? Dak!

234
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:08,385
Yes, Lord Vader, I’ve reached
the main power generators.

235
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:12,684
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

236
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:18,956
– Rogue Three.
– Copy, Rogue Leader.

237
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,163
<i>Wedge, I’ve lost my gunner. You’ll
have to make this shot. I’ll cover for you.</i>

238
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:27,727
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

239
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,006
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

240
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,010
Steady, Rogue Two.

241
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,280
Activate harpoon.

242
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,217
Good shot, Janson.

243
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,158
– One more pass.
– Coming around, Wedge.

244
00:28:55,132 --> 00:28:57,132
Cable out.
Let her go!

245
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,870
Detach cable.

246
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,770
Cable detached.

247
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:09,979
Come on.

248
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,987
– Hah! That got him!
– I see it, Wedge. Good work.

249
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,727
I don’t think we can protect
two transports at a time.

250
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:27,400
It’s risky, but we can’t hold out
much longer. We have no choice.

251
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,400
– Launch patrol.
– Evacuate remaining ground staff.

252
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,538
No, no! No.

253
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,803
This one goes there.
That one goes there, right?

254
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,813
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

255
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,347
And do take good care of yourself.

256
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

257
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:20,311
All troops will debark for ground assault.
Prepare to target the main generator.

258
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:27,457
– Rogue Two, are you all right?
– Yeah. I’m with you, Rogue Leader.

259
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:30,125
We’ll set harpoon.
I’ll cover for you.

260
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,230
– Coming around.
– Watch that cross fire, boys.

261
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,566
Set for position three.
Steady.

262
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:40,736
Stay tight and low.

263
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,903
Hobbie!
I’ve been hit!

264
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,600
– You all right?
– Why are you still here?

265
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,861
– Heard the command center had been hit.
– You’ve got your clearance to leave.

266
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:42,200
Don’t worry, I’ll leave. First I’m gonna
get you to your ship.

267
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,200
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It’s our only hope.

268
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,432
Send all troops in Sector 12 to the south slope
to protect the fighters.

269
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,509
<i>Imperial troops have entered the base.
Imperial troops have entered—</i>

270
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,807
– Come on. That’s it.
– Give the evacuation code signal.

271
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,618
– And get to your transports!
– Oh! Wait for me!

272
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,179
Begin retreat!
Fall back! Fall back!

273
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,117
– Distance to power generators?
– <i>17.28.</i>

274
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,696
Target.
Maximum firepower.

275
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,491
Transport, this is Solo.

276
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:51,391
Better take off. I can’t get to you.
I’ll get her out on the <i>Falcon</i>.

277
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,824
B-B-But where are you going?
Come back!

278
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:17,400
Wait! Wait for me!
Wait! Stop!

279
00:34:18,221 --> 00:34:19,921
– How typical!
– Come on.

280
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,464
Hurry up, Goldenrod. You’re gonna be
a permanent resident.

281
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,464
Wait! Wait!

282
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,454
– How’s this?
– Would it help if I got out and pushed?

283
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,820
– Captain Solo! Captain Solo!
– It might.

284
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,787
Sir, might I suggest that you—

285
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,800
It can wait.

286
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,335
This bucket of bolts is never gonna
get us past that blockade.

287
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,835
This baby’s got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

288
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:19,946
Come on! Come on! Switch over.
Let’s hope we don’t have a burnout.

289
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,654
– See?
– Someday you’re gonna be wrong...

290
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,754
...and I just hope I’m there to see it.

291
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,526
Punch it!

292
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:49,511
R2!

293
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:53,112
Get her ready for takeoff.

294
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:56,986
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

295
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:02,756
Don’t worry, R2.
We’re going. We’re going.

296
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,072
There’s nothing wrong, R2.

297
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,341
I’m just setting a new course.

298
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,479
We’re not gonna regroup with the others.

299
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:27,409
We’re going to the Dagobah system.

300
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,345
Yes, R2.

301
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,982
That’s all right. I’d like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

302
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,346
– I saw ’em! I saw ’em!
– Saw what?

303
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,548
Star destroyers,
two of ’em coming right at us.

304
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:01,648
– Sir! Sir! Might I suggest—
– Shut him up or shut him down!

305
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,819
Check the deflector shield.

306
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,216
Great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.

307
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:14,696
Take evasive action!

308
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,877
– Prepare to make the jump to light speed.
– But sir!

309
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,810
– They’re getting closer.
– Oh, yeah? Watch this.

310
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:38,887
Watch what?

311
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:43,161
– I think we’re in trouble.
– If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier...

312
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,793
...the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
It’s impossible to go to light speed.

313
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,164
We’re in trouble.

314
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,970
Horizontal boosters!

315
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,173
Alluvial dampers.

316
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,638
Ow! That’s not it.
Bring me the hydrospanners!

317
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,519
I don’t know how we’re gonna
get out of this one.

318
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,783
Ow! Chewie!

319
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:19,900
That wasn’t a laser blast.
Something hit us.

320
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,900
Han, get up here!

321
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
Come on, Chewie!

322
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,300
– Asteroids.
– Oh, no.

323
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,840
– Chewie, set two-seven-one.
– What are you doing?

324
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:39,247
– You’re not actually going into an asteroid field!
– They’d be crazy to follow us, wouldn’t they?

325
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:45,287
– You don’t have to do this to impress me.
– Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating...

326
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:49,988
– ...an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1.
– Never tell me the odds!

327
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,400
Look! Oh!

328
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:21,056
You said you wanted to be around when I made
a mistake. Well, this could be it, sweetheart.

329
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:25,830
I take it back. We’re going to get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

330
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,731
– Ain’t gonna argue with that.
– Pulverized?

331
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:30,868
– I’m going in closer to one of the big ones.
– Closer?!

332
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,768
Closer?!

333
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,956
– Oh, this is suicide!
– There. That looks pretty good.

334
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:07,236
– What looks pretty good?
– Yeah, that’ll do nicely.

335
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:10,432
Excuse me, ma’am,
but where are we going?

336
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,146
– I hope you know what you’re doing.
– Yeah, me too.

337
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,231
Yep, that’s it. Dagobah.

338
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,899
No, I’m not gonna change my mind about this.

339
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,600
I’m not picking up any cities or technology.

340
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,603
Massive life-form readings, though.
There’s something alive down there.

341
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,149
Yes. I’m sure it’s perfectly safe for droids.

342
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:05,286
I know! I know!
All the scopes are dead. I can’t see a thing.

343
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:08,527
Just hang on. I’m gonna start
the landing cycle.

344
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,317
No, R2, you stay put.
I’ll have a look around.

345
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,061
R2? R2!

346
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:17,565
Where are you?

347
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,470
R2!

348
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:30,678
You be more careful.

349
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,383
R2, that way.

350
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,147
R2!

351
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,043
Oh, no.

352
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:37,346
Are you all right?
Come on.

353
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,781
You’re lucky you don’t taste very good.

354
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:46,053
Anything broken?

355
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:52,795
If you’re saying coming here was a bad idea,
I’m beginning to agree with you.

356
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:56,690
R2, what are we doing here?

357
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:02,229
It’s like... something out of a dream or...

358
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:06,107
I don’t know.
Maybe I’m just going crazy.

359
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:41,537
– Yes, Admiral?
– Our ships have sighted...

360
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,516
...the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>, lord, but it has
entered an asteroid field, and we cannot risk—

361
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:51,283
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.
I want that ship, not excuses.

362
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:53,755
Yes, lord.

363
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:01,665
I’m gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

364
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:05,702
Sir, I’m almost afraid to ask, but...
does that include shutting me down, too?

365
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:09,799
No. I need you to talk to the <i>Falcon</i>.
Find out what’s wrong with the hyperdrive.

366
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:21,381
Sir, it’s quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

367
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:25,585
Not entirely stable? I’m glad you’re here
to tell us these things.

368
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:29,189
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

369
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,961
Sometimes I just don’t
understand human behavior.

370
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,429
After all, I’m only trying
to do my job in the most...

371
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,436
– Let go.
– Shh!

372
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,138
– Let go, please.
– Don’t get excited.

373
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,008
Captain, being held by you isn’t quite enough
to get me excited.

374
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:53,414
Sorry, sweetheart. I haven’t got time
for anything else.

375
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,020
What? Ready for some power?
Okay.

376
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:39,454
Let’s see now. Put that in there.
There you go.

377
00:46:42,598 --> 00:46:46,759
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...
if he even exists.

378
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:57,073
It’s really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

379
00:46:57,847 --> 00:47:00,047
This place gives me the creeps.

380
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:05,086
Still...

381
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:08,756
...there’s something familiar about this place.

382
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,989
I don’t know.
I feel like...

383
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:17,026
– Feel like what?
– Like we’re being watched!

384
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,061
Away put your weapon!
I mean you no harm.

385
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,073
I am wondering...
why are you here?

386
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:28,645
– I’m looking for someone.
– Looking?

387
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,543
Found someone you have,
I would say, hmmm?

388
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,600
Right.

389
00:47:35,384 --> 00:47:38,300
Help you I can.
Yes, mmmm.

390
00:47:38,721 --> 00:47:42,693
I don’t think so.
I’m looking for a great warrior.

391
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,992
Ah!
A great warrior.

392
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,165
Wars not make one great.

393
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:03,268
Put that down, now we—
Hey! That’s my dinner!

394
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,286
How you get so big eating food of this kind?

395
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:13,257
Listen, friend, we didn’t mean to land in that puddle,
and if we could get our ship out, we would.

396
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,458
– But we can’t, so why don’t you just—
– Ah, cannot get your ship out.

397
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:19,326
– Hey, get out of there!
– Ah!

398
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:23,897
– No! Aww...
– Hey, you could have broken this.

399
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,200
Don’t do that.

400
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,463
Oh!

401
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,813
You’re making a mess.

402
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,913
– Hey, give me that!
– Mine, or I will help you not.

403
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:47,201
I don’t want your help.
I want my lamp back.

404
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:49,501
I’m gonna need it
to get out of this slimy mudhole.

405
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:52,963
Mudhole? Slimy?
My home this is!

406
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,754
Wha... Mmm!

407
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:58,332
R2, let him have it.

408
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,903
– Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
– R2!

409
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,679
Now, will you move along, little fellow?
We’ve got a lot of work to do.

410
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:14,484
No! No, no! Stay and help you I will...
find your friend. Hmm?

411
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:18,251
I’m not looking for a friend.
I’m looking for a Jedi master.

412
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,622
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

413
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,455
– You seek Yoda.
– You know him?

414
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,965
Mmmm.
Take you to him I will.

415
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:33,662
Yes, yes, but now we must eat. Come.

416
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:36,871
Good food.
Come.

417
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,083
Come, come.

418
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:54,054
R2... stay and watch after the camp.

419
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,800
Oh! Where is R2 when I need him?

420
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,943
Sir, I don’t know where your ship
learned to communicate...

421
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:16,847
...but it has the most peculiar dialect.
I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling...

422
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:20,973
...on the negative axis has been polarized.
I’m afraid you’ll have to replace it.

423
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:24,651
Well, of course I’ll have to replace it.

424
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:27,388
Here... and Chewie?

425
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,087
I think we’d better replace
the negative power coupling.

426
00:50:54,383 --> 00:50:57,120
Hey, Your Worship, I’m only trying to help.

427
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,783
– Would you please stop calling me that?
– Sure, Leia.

428
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:05,962
– You make it so difficult sometimes.
– I do. I really do.

429
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:08,932
You could be a little nicer, though.

430
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,933
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I’m all right.

431
00:51:13,803 --> 00:51:15,937
Occasionally... maybe...

432
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,600
...when you aren’t acting like a scoundrel.

433
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,068
Scoundrel? Scoundrel?

434
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,941
I like the sound of that.

435
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,747
– Stop that.
– Stop what?

436
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,913
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

437
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:34,422
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

438
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,461
– Afraid?
– You’re trembling.

439
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,961
I’m not trembling.

440
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,859
You like me because I’m a scoundrel.
There aren’t enough scoundrels in your life.

441
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:49,527
– I happen to like nice men.
– I’m nice men.

442
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,906
No, you’re not. You’re—

443
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,841
Sir, sir! I’ve isolated
the reverse power flux coupling!

444
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,753
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

445
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,053
Oh, you’re perfectly welcome, sir.

446
00:52:10,893 --> 00:52:13,963
<i>And that, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

447
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:16,900
<i>Considering the amount of damage we’ve
sustained, they must have been destroyed.</i>

448
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,764
No, Captain.
They’re alive.

449
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:24,802
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

450
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:31,145
Lord Vader.

451
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:33,551
– Yes, Admiral. What is it?
– The Emperor commands you...

452
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,152
...to make contact with him.

453
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:39,889
Move the ship out of the asteroid field
so that we can send a clear transmission.

454
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:41,889
Yes, my lord.

455
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,635
What is thy bidding, my master?

456
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:04,836
<i>There is a great disturbance in the Force.</i>

457
00:53:05,514 --> 00:53:09,283
– I have felt it.
– <i>We have a new enemy...</i>

458
00:53:09,752 --> 00:53:11,752
<i>...Luke Skywalker.</i>

459
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:15,650
– Yes, my master.
– <i>He could destroy us.</i>

460
00:53:16,325 --> 00:53:20,822
He’s just a boy. Obi-Wan
can no longer help him.

461
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:26,198
<i>The Force is strong with him.
The son of Skywalker...</i>

462
00:53:26,298 --> 00:53:29,101
<i>...must not become a Jedi.</i>

463
00:53:29,672 --> 00:53:34,139
If he could be turned, he would
become a powerful ally.

464
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,606
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

465
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,680
<i>He would be a great asset.
Can it be done?</i>

466
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:46,188
He will join us or die, master.

467
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,877
Look, I’m sure it’s delicious. I just don’t
understand why we can’t see Yoda now.

468
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:12,277
Patience! For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

469
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:17,854
Eat, eat.

470
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,454
Hot!

471
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:29,000
Good food!
Mmm, good, hmm?

472
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:31,925
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

473
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:37,034
Not far. Yoda not far.
Patience. Soon you will be with him.

474
00:54:39,675 --> 00:54:42,576
Root leaf.
I cook.

475
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,082
Why wish you become Jedi? Hmm?

476
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:53,122
– Mostly because of my father, I guess.
– Ah, father. Powerful Jedi was he.

477
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:57,222
– Hee hee. Mmm, powerful Jedi.
– Oh, come on.

478
00:54:57,593 --> 00:55:00,296
How could you know my father?
You don’t even know who I am.

479
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:04,195
I don’t even know what I’m doing here.
We’re wasting our time!

480
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:09,637
I cannot teach him.
The boy has no patience.

481
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,368
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

482
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,242
Hmm...

483
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:21,616
Much anger in him...
like his father.

484
00:55:21,984 --> 00:55:25,450
<i>Was I any different</i>
<i>when you taught me?</i>

485
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,560
No. He is not ready.

486
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,260
Yoda.

487
00:55:35,363 --> 00:55:38,463
I am ready. I... Ben...
I can be a Jedi.

488
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,469
– Ben, tell him I’m read—
– Ready, are you?

489
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:43,869
What know you ready?

490
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,341
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

491
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:52,913
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

492
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:57,646
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

493
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,120
The most serious mind.

494
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,070
This one a long time have I watched.

495
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:08,554
All his life has he looked away...

496
00:56:08,931 --> 00:56:11,725
...to the future, to the horizon.

497
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:16,572
Never his mind on where he was... hmm?

498
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:20,300
What he was doing.
Hmph!

499
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:24,145
Adventure. Heh!
Excitement. Heh!

500
00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:29,612
A Jedi craves not these things.
You are reckless!

501
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:32,677
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

502
00:56:33,255 --> 00:56:38,488
He is too old. Yes, too old to
begin the training.

503
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:42,061
But I’ve learned so much.

504
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,167
– Will he finish what he begins?
– I won’t fail you.

505
00:56:54,176 --> 00:56:56,276
I’m not afraid.

506
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,513
Oh...

507
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:01,649
You will be.

508
00:57:03,152 --> 00:57:05,145
You will be.

509
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:50,915
– Sir, if I may venture an opinion—
– I’m not really interested in your opinion, 3PO.

510
00:57:51,015 --> 00:57:53,316
There’s something out there.

511
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,416
– Where?
– Outside, in the cave.

512
00:57:56,717 --> 00:57:58,422
There it is. Listen. Listen!

513
00:57:58,522 --> 00:58:00,412
– I’m going out there.
– Are you crazy?

514
00:58:00,512 --> 00:58:03,813
I just got this bucket back together.
I’m not going to let something tear it apart.

515
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,113
Then I’m going with you.

516
00:58:06,363 --> 00:58:09,363
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

517
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:11,464
Oh, no.

518
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:28,613
This ground sure feels strange.

519
00:58:29,285 --> 00:58:32,385
It doesn’t feel like rock.

520
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,996
– There’s an awful lot of moisture in here.
– I don’t know.

521
00:58:40,096 --> 00:58:44,359
– I have a bad feeling about this.
– Yeah.

522
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,159
Watch out!

523
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,998
It’s all right.
It’s all right.

524
00:58:50,098 --> 00:58:52,607
Yeah, that’s what I thought... mynock.

525
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:56,200
Chewie, check the rest of the ship
and make sure there are no more attached.

526
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,800
– Chewing on the power cables.
– Mynocks?

527
00:58:59,983 --> 00:59:02,947
Go on inside. We’ll clean them off
if there are any more.

528
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,700
Aagghh! Go away, go away,
beastly thing! Shoo! Shoo!

529
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:22,937
Wait a minute...

530
00:59:44,636 --> 00:59:47,129
– All right, Chewie! Let’s get out of here!
– The Empire is still out there!

531
00:59:47,229 --> 00:59:51,000
– I don’t think it’s wise to—
– No time to discuss this in committee!

532
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,300
I am not a committee!

533
00:59:58,808 --> 01:00:01,311
You can’t make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

534
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:03,911
Sit down, sweetheart!
We’re taking off!

535
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:10,454
– Look!
– I see it. I see it.

536
01:00:10,554 --> 01:00:12,856
– We’re doomed!
– The cave is collapsing.

537
01:00:12,956 --> 01:00:15,490
– This is no cave.
– What?

538
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:49,024
Run!

539
01:00:49,425 --> 01:00:53,293
Yes! A Jedi’s strength flows from the Force.

540
01:00:53,663 --> 01:00:55,499
But beware of the dark side.

541
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,601
Anger, fear, aggression.
The dark side of the Force are they.

542
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:03,200
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

543
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:07,900
If once you start down the dark path,
forever will it dominate your destiny.

544
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,714
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.

545
01:01:12,115 --> 01:01:13,715
Vader.

546
01:01:14,017 --> 01:01:17,754
– Is the dark side stronger?
– No, no.

547
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:21,756
No. Quicker, easier, more seductive.

548
01:01:22,024 --> 01:01:24,194
But how am I to know the good side
from the bad?

549
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:27,831
You will know when you are calm...

550
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:29,733
...at peace...

551
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,833
...passive.

552
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:34,704
A Jedi uses the Force...

553
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:38,580
...for knowledge and defense...
never for attack.

554
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,145
– But tell me why I can’t—
– No, no. There is no why.

555
01:01:42,245 --> 01:01:45,281
Nothing more will I teach you today.

556
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:47,906
Clear your mind of questions.

557
01:01:48,484 --> 01:01:50,284
Hmm...

558
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:53,021
Mmm...

559
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:12,839
There’s something not right here.

560
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:19,000
I feel cold...
death.

561
01:02:19,182 --> 01:02:24,500
That place is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

562
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:27,352
A domain of evil it is.

563
01:02:28,325 --> 01:02:30,724
In you must go.

564
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,600
What’s in there?

565
01:02:34,931 --> 01:02:37,931
Only what you take with you.

566
01:02:41,437 --> 01:02:45,237
Your weapons...
you will not need them.

567
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,790
Hmph.

568
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:27,202
Bounty hunters. We don’t need their scum.

569
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:31,130
– Yes, sir.
– Those rebels won’t escape us.

570
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:40,950
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer <i>Avenger</i>.

571
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:46,750
There will be a substantial reward for the one
who finds the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.

572
01:05:47,024 --> 01:05:50,160
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

573
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:54,860
...but I want them alive.
No disintegrations.

574
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:58,890
– As you wish.
– Lord Vader.

575
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:01,764
My lord, we have them.

576
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:09,000
Oh, thank goodness we’re coming
out of the asteroid field.

577
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:16,286
Let’s get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

578
01:06:16,386 --> 01:06:17,820
One...

579
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,355
...two...

580
01:06:19,455 --> 01:06:20,988
...three!

581
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:28,596
It’s not fair.

582
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,670
Transfer circuits aren’t working.
It’s not my fault!

583
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:37,136
– No light speed?
– It’s not my fault.

584
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:43,113
Sir, we’ve just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

585
01:06:43,213 --> 01:06:45,782
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we’re done for.

586
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:47,383
Turn her around.

587
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:50,153
I said turn her around! I’m going
to put all power in the front shield.

588
01:06:50,253 --> 01:06:53,201
– You’re going to attack them?!
– Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault...

589
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,082
– ...on an Imperial Star Destroyer—
– Shut up!

590
01:07:02,966 --> 01:07:05,266
They’re moving to attack position.

591
01:07:07,437 --> 01:07:09,137
Shields up.

592
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:16,746
Track them. They may come around
for another pass.

593
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:19,549
Captain Needa, the ship
no longer appears on our scopes.

594
01:07:19,649 --> 01:07:23,649
They can’t have disappeared.
No ship that small has a cloaking device.

595
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,401
Well, there’s no trace of them, sir.

596
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:28,289
Captain, Lord Vader demands
an update on the pursuit.

597
01:07:30,293 --> 01:07:32,495
Get a shuttle ready.

598
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:36,633
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader.

599
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:39,933
– Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
– Yes, Captain Needa.

600
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:48,474
Use the Force. Yes...

601
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,050
Now, the stone...

602
01:07:59,322 --> 01:08:01,322
Feel it.

603
01:08:12,636 --> 01:08:14,936
Concentrate!

604
01:08:29,585 --> 01:08:32,455
Oh, no. We’ll never get it out now.

605
01:08:32,555 --> 01:08:34,855
So certain are you.

606
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:41,688
Always with you it cannot be done.

607
01:08:42,766 --> 01:08:46,800
– Hear you nothing that I say?
– Master, moving stones around is one thing.

608
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:51,100
– This is totally different.
– No! No different!

609
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:56,607
Only different in your mind.
You must unlearn what you have learned.

610
01:08:58,213 --> 01:09:01,900
– All right. I’ll give it a try.
– No! Try not.

611
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:06,684
Do. Or do not.
There is no try.

612
01:09:55,337 --> 01:09:58,204
I can’t.
It’s too big.

613
01:09:58,574 --> 01:10:01,209
Size matters not.
Look at me.

614
01:10:01,877 --> 01:10:04,213
Judge me by my size, do you?

615
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:06,449
Hmm? Hmph!

616
01:10:06,549 --> 01:10:09,285
And well you should not...

617
01:10:09,385 --> 01:10:12,022
...for my ally is the Force.

618
01:10:12,122 --> 01:10:14,322
And a powerful ally it is.

619
01:10:15,658 --> 01:10:19,887
Life creates it,
makes it grow.

620
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:26,630
Its energy surrounds us
and binds us.

621
01:10:26,769 --> 01:10:31,140
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

622
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:35,111
You must feel the Force around you...

623
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:38,511
Here, between you, me...

624
01:10:38,781 --> 01:10:42,752
...the tree, the rock,
everywhere!

625
01:10:42,852 --> 01:10:44,352
Yes...

626
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:48,554
...even between the land
and the ship.

627
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:55,762
You want the impossible.

628
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:46,333
I don’t...
I don’t believe it.

629
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:50,076
That is why you fail.

630
01:13:09,398 --> 01:13:13,528
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

631
01:13:21,176 --> 01:13:24,747
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan of the area and found nothing.

632
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:28,400
If the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> went into light speed,
it’ll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.

633
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:32,100
Alert all commands.
Calculate every possible destination...

634
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:34,600
...along their last known trajectory.

635
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:38,800
– Yes, my lord. We’ll find them.
– Don’t fail me again...

636
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:41,255
...Admiral.

637
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,667
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.

638
01:14:01,317 --> 01:14:04,117
Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far!

639
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:08,057
No I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn’t anyone listen to me?

640
01:14:08,157 --> 01:14:10,158
The fleet’s beginning to break up.

641
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:13,559
Go back and stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

642
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,800
I really don’t see how that is going to help.

643
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,250
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

644
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:23,300
The Empire may be gracious enough to—

645
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:26,100
– Thank you.
– What’d you have in mind for your next move?

646
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,101
Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure,
they’ll dump their garbage...

647
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:32,101
...before they go to light speed,
and then we just float away.

648
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,901
With the rest of the garbage...
Then what?

649
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:38,554
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

650
01:14:38,654 --> 01:14:40,790
– Got any ideas?
– Well, where are we?

651
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:44,100
– Anoat system.
– Anoat system. There’s not much there.

652
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,000
No. Well, wait.
This is interesting.

653
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:51,167
– Lando.
– Lando system?

654
01:14:51,267 --> 01:14:54,502
Lando’s not a system.
He’s a man. Lando Calrissian.

655
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:58,403
He’s this card player, gambler, scoundrel.
You’d like him.

656
01:14:59,174 --> 01:15:03,274
– Thanks.
– Bespin. It’s pretty far, but I think we can make it.

657
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:07,850
– A mining colony?
– Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

658
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:10,100
Lando conned somebody out of it.

659
01:15:10,353 --> 01:15:13,753
We go back a long way, Lando and me.

660
01:15:14,256 --> 01:15:17,124
– Can you trust him?
– No.

661
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:20,929
But he’s got no love for the Empire,
I can tell you that.

662
01:15:21,029 --> 01:15:22,932
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by.

663
01:15:23,032 --> 01:15:24,632
Detach.

664
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:33,209
You do have your moments.

665
01:15:33,309 --> 01:15:37,109
Not many of them, but you do have them.

666
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:09,540
Concentrate.
Feel the Force flow.

667
01:16:10,412 --> 01:16:12,012
Yes.

668
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:21,423
Good.

669
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:24,523
Calm. Yes.

670
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:27,930
Through the Force, things you will see.

671
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:31,701
Other places.
The future. The past.

672
01:16:31,801 --> 01:16:34,835
Old friends long gone.

673
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,100
Han?

674
01:16:38,274 --> 01:16:39,974
Leia!

675
01:16:42,845 --> 01:16:44,514
Hmm...

676
01:16:44,614 --> 01:16:48,114
Control, control.
You must learn control!

677
01:16:51,086 --> 01:16:54,886
I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.

678
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:58,890
Hmm...
Friends you have there.

679
01:16:59,728 --> 01:17:03,428
– They were in pain.
– It is the future you see.

680
01:17:04,967 --> 01:17:06,667
Future?

681
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,710
Will they die?

682
01:17:19,215 --> 01:17:21,183
Difficult to see.

683
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:24,283
Always in motion is the future.

684
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,800
I’ve got to go to them.

685
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:32,761
Decide you must how to serve them best.

686
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:36,200
If you leave now,
help them you could, but...

687
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:41,233
...you would destroy all for which
they have fought and suffered.

688
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:57,153
No, I don’t have a landing permit.

689
01:17:57,253 --> 01:18:01,153
I’m trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

690
01:18:01,556 --> 01:18:05,394
– Whoah! Wait a minute! Let me explain!
– <i>You will not deviate from your present course.</i>

691
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:08,594
– Rather touchy, aren’t they?
– I thought you knew this person.

692
01:18:11,099 --> 01:18:14,730
Well, that was a long time ago.
I’m sure he’s forgotten about that.

693
01:18:22,477 --> 01:18:26,177
<i>Permission granted to land</i>
<i>on Platform 327.</i>

694
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,300
Thank you.

695
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:32,221
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

696
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,221
Who’s worried?

697
01:19:07,522 --> 01:19:11,859
– Oh. No one to meet us.
– I don’t like this.

698
01:19:12,927 --> 01:19:15,900
– What would you like?
– Well, they did let us land.

699
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,333
Look, don’t worry. Everything’s
gonna be fine. Trust me.

700
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:27,306
See? My friend.

701
01:19:31,346 --> 01:19:33,646
Keep your eyes open, huh?

702
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:37,518
Hey!

703
01:19:37,886 --> 01:19:42,288
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

704
01:19:42,388 --> 01:19:46,988
You’ve got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

705
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:01,231
How you doin’, you old pirate?
So good to see you!

706
01:20:01,809 --> 01:20:03,879
Well, he seems very friendly.

707
01:20:03,979 --> 01:20:06,479
Yes.
Very friendly.

708
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:10,886
– What are you doing here?
– Ah, repairs. I thought you could help me out.

709
01:20:10,986 --> 01:20:13,446
– What have you done to my ship?
– <i>Your</i> ship?

710
01:20:13,546 --> 01:20:17,793
Hey, remember you lost her to me
fair and square.

711
01:20:17,893 --> 01:20:20,196
And how you doin’, Chewbacca?

712
01:20:20,296 --> 01:20:22,696
You still hanging around with this loser?

713
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:27,167
Hello.
What have we here?

714
01:20:28,303 --> 01:20:32,207
Welcome, I’m Lando Calrissian.
I’m the administrator of this facility.

715
01:20:32,307 --> 01:20:35,510
– And who might you be?
– Leia.

716
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:37,910
Welcome, Leia.

717
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:43,000
All right, all right, you old smoothie.

718
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:46,400
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

719
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,500
My facilities are at your...
Well, really!

720
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,250
– What’s wrong with the <i>Falcon</i>?
– Hyperdrive.

721
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:54,350
– I’ll get my people to work on it.
– Good.

722
01:20:54,450 --> 01:21:00,050
You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times.
She’s the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

723
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:03,005
How’s the gas mine?
It still paying off for you?

724
01:21:03,105 --> 01:21:06,842
Oh, not as well as I’d like. We’re a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

725
01:21:06,942 --> 01:21:12,050
And I’ve had supply problems of every kind,
I’ve had labor difficulties, I’ve had...

726
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,749
What’s so funny?

727
01:21:13,849 --> 01:21:16,986
You. Listen to you.
You sound like a businessman...

728
01:21:17,086 --> 01:21:20,400
...a responsible leader.
Who’d have thought that, huh?

729
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,859
You know, seeing you brings back
a few things.

730
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:27,024
– Yeah.
– Yeah, I’m responsible these days.

731
01:21:27,995 --> 01:21:31,131
It’s the price you pay for being successful.

732
01:21:33,201 --> 01:21:35,392
Oh. Nice to see a familiar face.

733
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:37,771
How rude!

734
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,650
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

735
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:45,400
I wonder if...
Hello? Hello?

736
01:21:45,514 --> 01:21:47,916
– How interesting.
– Who are you?

737
01:21:48,016 --> 01:21:51,242
Oh, my! I... I’m terribly sorry.
I didn’t mean to intrude.

738
01:21:51,443 --> 01:21:53,343
N-N-No, please don’t get up.

739
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:14,201
Luke, you must complete the training.

740
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:17,500
I can’t keep the vision out of my head.
They’re my friends. I’ve got to help them.

741
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,750
– You must not go.
– But Han and Leia will die if I don’t.

742
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:24,050
<i>You don’t know that.</i>

743
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:28,188
<i>Even Yoda cannot see their fate.</i>

744
01:22:28,656 --> 01:22:31,250
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.

745
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:33,328
<i>But you cannot control it.</i>

746
01:22:33,428 --> 01:22:35,864
<i>This is a dangerous time for you...</i>

747
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:39,435
<i>...when you will be tempted</i>
<i>by the dark side of the Force.</i>

748
01:22:39,535 --> 01:22:43,000
Yes! Yes!
To Obi-Wan you listen.

749
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:46,865
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

750
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,801
But I’ve learned so much since then.
Master Yoda, I promise to return...

751
01:22:50,901 --> 01:22:53,447
...and finish what I’ve begun.
You have my word.

752
01:22:54,216 --> 01:22:57,186
<i>It is you and your abilities
the Emperor wants.</i>

753
01:22:57,286 --> 01:23:00,186
<i>That is why your friends</i>
<i>are made to suffer.</i>

754
01:23:01,156 --> 01:23:03,356
That’s why I have to go.

755
01:23:03,492 --> 01:23:07,992
<i>Luke, I don’t want to lose you
to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.</i>

756
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,565
You won’t.

757
01:23:10,665 --> 01:23:14,800
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.

758
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:17,272
Only a fully-trained Jedi knight...

759
01:23:17,372 --> 01:23:21,800
...with the Force as his ally, will conquer
Vader and his Emperor.

760
01:23:21,977 --> 01:23:28,300
If you end your training now... if you choose
the quick and easy path, as Vader did...

761
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,499
– ...you will become an agent of evil.
– <i>Patience.</i>

762
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,456
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

763
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:38,727
If you honor what they fight for... yes.

764
01:23:38,827 --> 01:23:41,930
<i>If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.</i>

765
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:44,230
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

766
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:48,034
I understand.

767
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,040
R2.

768
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,700
Fire up the converters.

769
01:23:58,847 --> 01:24:03,085
<i>Luke!
Don’t give in to hate.</i>

770
01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:05,888
<i>That leads to the dark side.</i>

771
01:24:05,988 --> 01:24:10,588
Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

772
01:24:11,025 --> 01:24:15,762
I will. And I’ll return.
I promise.

773
01:24:22,204 --> 01:24:25,250
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.

774
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:28,700
Now...
matters are worse.

775
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,439
– <i>That boy is our last hope.</i>
– No, there is another.

776
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:01,450
The ship’s almost finished. Two or three
more things and we’re in great shape.

777
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:05,750
The sooner the better. Something’s wrong here.
No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO.

778
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,317
He’s been gone too long to have gotten lost.

779
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:12,922
Relax. I’ll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

780
01:25:13,022 --> 01:25:17,700
– I don’t trust Lando.
– Well, I don’t trust him either.

781
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:22,863
He is my friend.
Besides, we’ll soon be gone.

782
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,264
Then you’re as good as gone, aren’t you?

783
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:02,401
What happened?

784
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,900
Where?

785
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,700
Found him in a junk pile?

786
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,350
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

787
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:16,773
– Lando’s got people that can fix him.
– No thanks.

788
01:26:17,851 --> 01:26:22,579
– I’m sorry, am I interrupting anything?
– Not really.

789
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,696
You look absolutely beautiful.

790
01:26:27,796 --> 01:26:31,200
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

791
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:35,300
– Thank you.
– Would you join me for a little refreshment?

792
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,763
Everyone’s invited, of course.

793
01:26:38,974 --> 01:26:43,701
– Having trouble with your droid?
– No, no problem. Why?

794
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,200
So you see, since we’re a small operation,
we don’t fall into...

795
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:58,050
...the jurisdiction of the Empire.

796
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:00,550
– So you’re part of the Mining Guild, then?
– No, not actually.

797
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,970
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

798
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:07,100
Which is advantageous for everybody, since
our customers are anxious to avoid...

799
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,500
...attracting attention to themselves.

800
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,750
Aren’t you afraid the Empire’s going to find out
about this little operation... shut you down?

801
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:16,912
It’s always been a danger, but it looms
like a shadow over everything we’ve built here.

802
01:27:17,012 --> 01:27:19,481
But things have developed
that’ll ensure security.

803
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:23,681
I’ve just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

804
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:36,661
We would be honored if you would join us.

805
01:27:42,803 --> 01:27:45,603
I had no choice. They arrived
right before you did.

806
01:27:45,907 --> 01:27:47,707
I’m sorry.

807
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:53,374
I’m sorry, too.

808
01:28:07,463 --> 01:28:09,463
No, 3PO’s with them.

809
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,400
Just hang on.
We’re almost there.

810
01:29:12,059 --> 01:29:14,262
I’m terribly sorry.
I didn’t mean to intrude.

811
01:29:14,362 --> 01:29:16,796
N-N-No, please don’t get up.

812
01:29:20,202 --> 01:29:22,003
No!

813
01:29:22,103 --> 01:29:25,403
Stormtroopers? Here?
We’re in danger!

814
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:28,650
I must tell the others.
Oh, no, I’ve been shot!

815
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,772
Lord Vader.

816
01:29:57,872 --> 01:30:02,400
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt
after I have Skywalker.

817
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,750
He’s no good to me dead.

818
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:07,850
He will not be permanently damaged.

819
01:30:10,051 --> 01:30:12,855
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

820
01:30:12,955 --> 01:30:15,700
They must never again leave this city.

821
01:30:15,824 --> 01:30:18,961
That was never a condition of our agreement,
nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

822
01:30:19,061 --> 01:30:22,561
Perhaps you think you’re
being treated unfairly?

823
01:30:25,633 --> 01:30:28,200
– No.
– Good. It would be unfortunate...

824
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:31,264
...if I had to leave a garrison here.

825
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,708
This deal is getting worse all the time.

826
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:38,514
Oh, yes, that’s very good.
I like that.

827
01:30:38,614 --> 01:30:40,114
Oh!

828
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,785
Something’s not right,
because now I can’t see.

829
01:30:43,885 --> 01:30:47,789
Oh, oh, oh,
that’s much better.

830
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:51,524
Wait! Wait! Oh, my!
What have you done?

831
01:30:51,792 --> 01:30:54,996
I’m backwards!
You flea-bitten furball!

832
01:30:55,096 --> 01:30:58,696
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough—

833
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,680
I feel terrible.

834
01:31:29,697 --> 01:31:31,897
Why are they doing this?

835
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:38,000
They never even asked me any questions.

836
01:31:41,809 --> 01:31:43,401
Lando.

837
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:49,400
– Get out of here, Lando.
– Shut up and listen! Vader’s agreed...

838
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,800
– ...to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
– Over to you...

839
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,689
They’ll have to stay here,
but at least they’ll be safe.

840
01:31:53,789 --> 01:31:56,500
– What about Han?
– Vader’s giving him to the bounty hunter.

841
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,800
– Vader wants us all dead.
– He doesn’t want you at all.

842
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:01,300
He’s after somebody called, uh, Skywalker.

843
01:32:01,762 --> 01:32:04,000
– Luke.
– Lord Vader set a trap for him.

844
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:06,333
– And we’re the bait!
– Yeah, well, he’s on his way.

845
01:32:06,433 --> 01:32:10,172
Perfect... you fixed us all
real good, didn’t you?

846
01:32:10,272 --> 01:32:12,272
My friend.

847
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,535
Stop!

848
01:32:17,345 --> 01:32:19,179
I’ve done all I can.

849
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,800
I’m sorry I couldn’t do better,
but I’ve got my own problems.

850
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:25,000
Yeah.
You’re a real hero.

851
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,657
You certainly have a way with people.

852
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,649
This facility is crude...

853
01:32:54,749 --> 01:32:59,849
...but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker
for his journey to the Emperor.

854
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,924
Lord Vader, ship approaching,
X-wing class.

855
01:33:03,024 --> 01:33:07,024
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

856
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,050
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing.

857
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:15,838
– You put him in there, it might kill him.
– I do not want the Emperor’s prize damaged.

858
01:33:15,938 --> 01:33:19,629
We will test it...
on Captain Solo.

859
01:33:42,796 --> 01:33:47,034
If only you’d attached my legs,
I wouldn’t be in this ridiculous position.

860
01:33:47,134 --> 01:33:50,138
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

861
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:52,503
...so don’t do anything foolish.

862
01:34:05,453 --> 01:34:08,300
What’s going on...
buddy?

863
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:10,959
You’re being put into carbon freeze.

864
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:14,529
What if he doesn’t survive?
He’s worth a lot to me.

865
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:18,629
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

866
01:34:23,671 --> 01:34:25,605
Stop, Chewie, stop, stop!

867
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,650
Yes, stop, please!
I’m not ready to die!

868
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:31,346
Hey! Hey! Listen to me, Chewie.

869
01:34:31,446 --> 01:34:34,700
Chewie, this won’t help me.
Hey, save your strength.

870
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,900
There’ll be another time.

871
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:42,018
The princess... you have to
take care of her.

872
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,700
Do you hear me? Huh?

873
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,275
I love you.

874
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:03,104
I know.

875
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:35,700
What’s going on? Turn around!
Chewbacca, I can’t see.

876
01:36:33,634 --> 01:36:36,300
Oh, they’ve encased him in carbonite.

877
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:40,041
He should be quite well-protected,
if he survived the freezing process, that is.

878
01:36:40,141 --> 01:36:42,641
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

879
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:47,700
Yes, he’s alive.
And in perfect hibernation.

880
01:36:48,082 --> 01:36:50,882
He’s all yours, bounty hunter.

881
01:36:51,052 --> 01:36:53,677
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

882
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,592
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

883
01:36:57,692 --> 01:37:01,692
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

884
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,671
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

885
01:37:09,771 --> 01:37:12,140
You said they’d be left in the city
under my supervision.

886
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:16,740
I am altering the deal.
Pray I don’t alter it any further.

887
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:57,669
Luke! Luke, don’t,
it’s a trap!

888
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,400
It’s a trap!

889
01:39:45,692 --> 01:39:49,053
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

890
01:39:50,531 --> 01:39:53,523
But you are not a Jedi yet.

891
01:40:54,828 --> 01:40:56,828
Well done.

892
01:40:58,165 --> 01:41:02,465
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet. Move.

893
01:41:07,775 --> 01:41:10,600
– What do you think you’re doing?
– We’re getting out of here.

894
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:12,650
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

895
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:15,799
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, that we’re going to trust you?

896
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,850
I had no choice.

897
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:19,950
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

898
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,957
We understand, don’t we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

899
01:41:23,057 --> 01:41:27,400
– I’m just trying to help.
– We don’t need any of your help.

900
01:41:27,528 --> 01:41:29,228
Haaa...

901
01:41:30,664 --> 01:41:32,399
Ha... Ha...

902
01:41:32,499 --> 01:41:34,100
– What?
– Han...

903
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:39,200
– It sounds like Han.
– There’s still a chance to save Han...

904
01:41:39,306 --> 01:41:41,506
...at the east...

905
01:41:41,642 --> 01:41:43,510
...platform.

906
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:45,210
Chewie.

907
01:41:47,047 --> 01:41:50,847
I’m terribly sorry about all this.
After all, he’s only a Wookiee.

908
01:41:51,552 --> 01:41:54,552
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.

909
01:42:09,971 --> 01:42:11,971
R2, R2, where have you been?

910
01:42:12,573 --> 01:42:14,573
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

911
01:42:15,242 --> 01:42:18,400
Hurry! Hurry! We’re trying to save Han
from the bounty hunter.

912
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:23,250
Well, at least you’re still in one piece.

913
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:25,550
Look what happened to me!

914
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,300
Oh, no! Chewie, they’re behind you!

915
01:42:53,247 --> 01:42:55,600
You have learned much, young one.

916
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:58,100
You’ll find I’m full of surprises.

917
01:43:09,196 --> 01:43:12,396
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

918
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,700
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

919
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,567
No.

920
01:43:23,945 --> 01:43:26,044
All too easy.

921
01:43:30,285 --> 01:43:33,485
Perhaps you’re not as strong
as the Emperor thought.

922
01:43:36,357 --> 01:43:38,552
Impressive.

923
01:43:39,661 --> 01:43:41,761
Most impressive.

924
01:43:48,569 --> 01:43:50,838
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

925
01:43:50,938 --> 01:43:53,838
You have controlled your fear.

926
01:43:55,309 --> 01:43:58,609
Now...
release your anger.

927
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,100
Only your hatred can destroy me.

928
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,457
Argh!

929
01:46:12,253 --> 01:46:16,100
– The security code has been changed.
– R2, you can tell the computer...

930
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,300
...to override the security systems.

931
01:46:18,592 --> 01:46:20,692
R2, hurry!

932
01:46:21,062 --> 01:46:24,750
Attention. This is Lando Calrissian.
The Empire has taken control of the city.

933
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:28,150
I advise everyone to leave
before more Imperial troops arrive.

934
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:37,100
– This way.
– Well, don’t blame me. I’m an interpreter.

935
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:40,300
I’m not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

936
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:06,000
Ah! We’re not interested in the hyperdrive on
the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>. It’s fixed!

937
01:47:09,242 --> 01:47:12,075
Just open the door, you stupid lump!

938
01:47:20,987 --> 01:47:24,187
I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!

939
01:47:46,447 --> 01:47:48,400
Ouch! Oh! Ouch that hurts!

940
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:51,000
Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!

941
01:47:56,122 --> 01:47:57,900
Leia!

942
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,700
Go!

943
01:48:05,498 --> 01:48:07,998
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

944
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,370
Of course I’ve looked better!

945
01:49:04,591 --> 01:49:08,195
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

946
01:49:08,295 --> 01:49:11,295
Don’t let yourself be destroyed,
as Obi-Wan did.

947
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:29,549
There is no escape.

948
01:49:29,649 --> 01:49:32,549
Don’t make me destroy you.

949
01:49:34,288 --> 01:49:38,600
Luke... you do not yet realize
your importance.

950
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,550
You have only begun to discover your power.

951
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:45,750
Join me, and I will complete your training.

952
01:49:45,966 --> 01:49:48,400
With our combined strength...

953
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:51,400
...we can end this destructive conflict...

954
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,900
...and bring order to the galaxy.

955
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:55,976
I’ll never join you!

956
01:49:56,076 --> 01:50:00,576
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

957
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:05,150
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

958
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:07,481
He told me enough.

959
01:50:09,456 --> 01:50:11,956
– He told me you killed him.
– No.

960
01:50:12,626 --> 01:50:15,426
I am your father.

961
01:50:19,533 --> 01:50:22,233
No... no...

962
01:50:23,403 --> 01:50:25,403
That’s not true.

963
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,975
That’s impossible!

964
01:50:28,075 --> 01:50:31,575
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

965
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,900
No!

966
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,600
No!

967
01:50:39,019 --> 01:50:42,419
Luke. You can destroy the Emperor.

968
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:46,650
He has foreseen this.
It is your destiny.

969
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:51,750
Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy...

970
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:54,250
...as father and son.

971
01:51:04,578 --> 01:51:06,446
Come with me.

972
01:51:06,546 --> 01:51:08,946
It is the only way.

973
01:52:15,082 --> 01:52:16,882
Ben.

974
01:52:17,317 --> 01:52:19,417
Ben, please.

975
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,300
Ben.

976
01:52:35,302 --> 01:52:36,902
Leia.

977
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:49,171
Hear me.

978
01:52:50,283 --> 01:52:51,825
Leia.

979
01:52:51,925 --> 01:52:53,625
Luke.

980
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,600
– We’ve got to go back.
– What?

981
01:52:57,750 --> 01:53:00,350
– I know where Luke is.
– Well, what about those fighters?

982
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,460
– Chewie, just do it.
– But what about Vader?

983
01:53:03,661 --> 01:53:06,297
All right, all right, all right!

984
01:53:13,206 --> 01:53:15,306
Bring my shuttle.

985
01:53:25,851 --> 01:53:28,251
Look, someone’s up there.

986
01:53:29,589 --> 01:53:31,700
It’s Luke.
Chewie, slow down.

987
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:35,600
Slow down, and we’ll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

988
01:53:46,973 --> 01:53:49,373
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

989
01:54:11,298 --> 01:54:13,858
– Lando?
– <i>Okay, let’s go.</i>

990
01:54:30,684 --> 01:54:32,986
Oh, Leia.

991
01:54:33,086 --> 01:54:35,086
All right, Chewie, let’s go.

992
01:54:49,436 --> 01:54:51,336
I’ll be back.

993
01:54:57,144 --> 01:54:59,277
Star Destroyer.

994
01:55:03,684 --> 01:55:06,184
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

995
01:55:06,553 --> 01:55:10,891
If your people fixed the hyperdrive...
All the coordinates are set. It’s now or never.

996
01:55:10,991 --> 01:55:12,591
Punch it!

997
01:55:23,136 --> 01:55:25,100
They told me they fixed it.

998
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:29,000
I trusted them to fix it!
It’s not my fault!

999
01:55:35,515 --> 01:55:38,150
They’ll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1000
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:41,650
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>?

1001
01:55:42,189 --> 01:55:44,000
– Yes, my lord.
– Good.

1002
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:48,250
Prepare the boarding party,
and set your weapons for stun.

1003
01:55:48,350 --> 01:55:50,850
– Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
– Yes, sir.

1004
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:55,549
Noisy brute. Why don’t we just
go into light speed?

1005
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:57,537
We can’t?

1006
01:55:57,637 --> 01:56:00,337
How would you know the hyperdrive
is deactivated?

1007
01:56:03,338 --> 01:56:05,600
The city’s central computer told you?

1008
01:56:06,301 --> 01:56:09,301
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1009
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:13,280
Ouch! Pay attention to what you’re doing!

1010
01:56:23,663 --> 01:56:26,863
– Luke.
– Father.

1011
01:56:27,767 --> 01:56:31,067
Son, come with me.

1012
01:56:32,839 --> 01:56:34,639
Ben.

1013
01:56:35,242 --> 01:56:38,233
Why didn’t you tell me?

1014
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,600
Chewie!

1015
01:56:55,929 --> 01:56:57,826
It’s Vader.

1016
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:06,500
Luke, it is your destiny.

1017
01:57:11,211 --> 01:57:12,911
Ben.

1018
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,748
Why didn’t you tell me?

1019
01:57:22,656 --> 01:57:24,756
Alert all commands.

1020
01:57:24,991 --> 01:57:27,191
Ready for the tractor beam.

1021
01:57:29,762 --> 01:57:33,033
R2, come back at once!
You haven’t finished with me yet.

1022
01:57:33,133 --> 01:57:36,400
You don’t know how to fix
the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1023
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:41,000
I’m standing here in pieces, and you’re
having delusions of grandeur!

1024
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:46,438
You did it!

1025
01:58:43,102 --> 01:58:46,902
– Luke, we’re ready for takeoff.
– <i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1026
01:58:47,339 --> 01:58:51,200
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt
and that bounty hunter, we’ll contact you.</i>

1027
01:58:51,644 --> 01:58:54,144
I’ll meet you at the rendezvous point
on Tatooine.

1028
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:57,700
Princess, we’ll find Han.
I promise.

1029
01:58:57,951 --> 01:59:01,951
Chewie, I’ll be waiting for your signal.
Take care, you two.

1030
01:59:02,422 --> 01:59:04,722
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>

1031
01:59:17,203 --> 01:59:18,803
Ow!
