It's incredibly rare when a television network

5
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,439
can hone on the sensibility of an entire generation,

6
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,500
and immediately click with its audience.

7
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,020
For my parent's generation, that was MTV,

8
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:49,439
but for my generation, it was, and continues to be, Adult Swim.

9
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,439
Adult Swim may have evolved into the animation empire we know it as now,

10
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,219
but didn't start out that way.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,000
Now let me take you back to 1992.

12
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,640
Ted Turner had just launched the Cartoon Network.

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,740
A channel with absolutely no original programming

14
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,979
that was built on the back of the MGM cartoon libraries

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,180
Turner had acquired.

16
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,540
So it was essentially the Hannah Barbera re-run channel.

17
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,439
But Turner wants to make the foray

18
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,719
into original programming.

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,340
And that first original program was Space Ghost: Coast to Coast.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,240
It was the brain child of Mike Lazzo: Cartoon Network's original head programmer

21
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,140
that would later go on to head up Adult Swim.

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,060
Lazzo was a huge fan of the short-lived Space Ghost cartoon from 1966,

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,960
and since he had access to those cartoons through the

24
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,379
Hanna-Barbera libraries,

25
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:35,559
he had the idea to re-contextualize those original animation cels

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,960
and splice them in with interviews of actors and musicians,

27
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,039
giving the washed-up superhero his own talk show.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,760
Space Ghost: "Hello, I am Space Ghost. Welcome to my show."

29
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,520
So, why the need for re-purposing

30
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,679
animations from the 60s?

31
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,500
Well, for the first four years of the show,

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,540
there was basically no money

33
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,160
allocated to the production budget.

34
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,519
Space Ghost was an all volunteer gig since the

35
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,439
network was hemorrhaging money at that point.

36
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,340
There was no safety net, it was a trial by fire effort.

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,320
But the lack of funding and the indie garage feel gave Space Ghost

38
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,339
a unique aesthetic that was different than anything else on late night at the time.

39
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,500
Space Ghost: "Okay, so explain this now: your human dad, put his human penis

40
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,879
in your shark mother's vagina,

41
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,419

deconstructed and redefined the format.

It changed the conception of what television could be,

75
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,019

But Adult Swim wasn't just about giving content

177
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:08,779
a second chance.

178
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,500
It was about giving it that first chance. ♪[beatmasta.oknd] - [top.down] Beatmasta x Altitude♪

179
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,199
It's a hub where creators can create.

180
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,720
Where the art is experimental and trangressive;

181
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
it's surreal, it's sloppy,

182
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,079
it's a place that welcomes risk-taking,

183
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,919
that wouldn't immediately dismiss a show where the

184
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,319
main character is literally a pair of ass cheeks.

Adult Swim cancelled your favorite show?

186
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:27,199
Good.

187
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,920
The important part is it gave you a favorite show.

Most of which weren't even designed for longevity,

189
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,979
they're supposed to be fleeting, that what makes them so special.

190
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,539
It's about spontaneity,

191
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,660
it's about the community,

192
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,140
it's about the experience,

193
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,220
and that one thing you can't get from Netflix.
