00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:20,779
the poison of these mushrooms it can

184
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,250
only be cured by another form of

185
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:24,799
mushroom so we have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">careful but these mushrooms are insanely</font>

187
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,800
powerful because by taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> them it'll</font>

188
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:34,610
based on replies<font color="#CCCCCC"> Randall again uh yeah</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Co if you really want regardless of</font>

193
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,980
his role because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 20 by just</font>

194
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:50,349
making Randall move

195
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,480

199
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:01,328
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want him to go through a</font>

200
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,740
heavily<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'll listen a new dad no</font>

201
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:04,448
Randall Randall doesn't have an

202
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,839
ownership Randall's kind of like just

203
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:10,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's a few he's part of part of co is a</font>

204
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,510
way to think of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Randall &amp; Co are</font>

205
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:16,389
of one mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's so the reason</font>

206
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:19,208
exists know the reason why he thought

207
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,879
Roman was dad is because deep down co is

208
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:23,338
always seen Roman as a fatherly figure

209
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:26,350
because his dad wasn't a really good dad

210
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,089
that's that's all it was and co was also

211
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,570
captivated by jakes music because he

212
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:34,690
just loves his go with older brothers

213
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">music and you know that's why Randall</font>

214
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,160
was able to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and neither of them</font>

215
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,980
ever touched me when pause goes to make

216
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:43,838
it pause goes to handle it in co has the

217
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,240
immediate reaction of<font color="#E5E5E5"> no and looks</font>

218
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,389
towards his<font color="#CCCCCC"> real dad in which case the</font>

219
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,240
cloud moves and co gets that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Coco</font>

220
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:55,329
suddenly realizes the bond he has with

221
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:00,129
Randall now like whoa I mind control you

222
00:09:55,328 --> 00:10:03,578
cool yay mess with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fire over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

223
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:05,110
you can however dad says dad again we

224
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:06,578
like he was still talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

225
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,990
mushrooms it's like so we need to be

226
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:10,419
really careful when picking these

227
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,039
mushrooms the poison mushrooms are

228
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:16,559
terrible and the other mushrooms will be

229
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,559
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very helpful in letting us defeat</font>

230
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:24,818
bo boppin also keep in mind that even

231
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,379
touching those poisonous mushrooms can

232
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:28,750
inherently infect you so when we're

233
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:32,318
picking them we have to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

234
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,669
careful in the middle of this discussion

235
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:34,719
Jake walks over to start touching the

236
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:37,059
fire what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do with fire</font>

237
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,610
chick I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to touch it okay go</font>

238
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:45,239
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and roll okay cool per year all</font>

239
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,940
right Jake burns his hand slightly nice

240
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,009
i'm glad you too Jake Jake you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

241
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,560
touch my shoulder yo check out this fire

242
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:57,240
can I wrote the touch of shoulder hip

243
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,239
touch his shoulder go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

244
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,769
you go to touch a shoulder but

245
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,339
accidentally touches nuts that's a

246
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:09,278
common problem with worse apparently it

247
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:12,040
was definitely an accident and mistakes

248
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:16,929
were made and I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> flee regret this</font>

249
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:18,789
occurrence corpsman corpsman explains

250
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:20,409
that the best way to go through this

251
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:25,539
dungeon is going to be the long way

252
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:29,909
around so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going all the way around is</font>

253
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:32,379
going to be the safest way to getting to

254
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:34,539
boken who is in this big room by the

255
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:37,480
lake he explains that while they could

256
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:40,059
probably get in via the lake it would be

257
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,199
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to swim and he</font>

258
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,319
doesn't think we're gonna be able to

259
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:50,229
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of things to build a boat</font>

260
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:51,610
pause maybe we were so short cuts yet

261
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,409
this is the but this is the best

262
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,899
shortcut is to go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ignore</font>

263
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:58,299
these middle judge is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the long cut yeah</font>

264
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:01,448
the shortcut is to go the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long way and</font>

265
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:04,389
avoid it do you see these orange walls

266
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:06,458
<font color="#E5E5E5">then that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the skeleton space by</font>

267
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:10,149
going on the outskirts they can avoid

268
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:13,088
avoid much of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inner skeleton</font>

269
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:15,159
tribes and not have to try to fight past

270
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,260
the gates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just go around and go</font>

271
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:20,289
through the secret passage core<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matic</font>

272
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:22,870
explains that if you guys can solve the

273
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:25,269
riddles of the lion king you'll be able

274
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:28,568
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the secret passage to get right</font>

275
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:30,789
into bogans layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to solve I want</font>

276
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:33,068
to smell the roses office for medical or

277
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:36,519
tells the answer Hakuna Matata<font color="#CCCCCC"> cormac</font>

278
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:38,289
explains that the riddle is given by the

279
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,929
lion king he doesn't actually know the

280
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:43,509
riddles wait dad are you liking no no

282
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:48,669
the lion king is even a lion it's

283
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:51,729
personal in the dungeon apparently can

284
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:53,948
let them get past so does everything is

285
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,649

290
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,629
point Cormac is fully into the dad thing

291
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,250
he now refers to you as sons just

292
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">because he's realized that's a great</font>

things no pause you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just Cormac</font>

295
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:26,529
tells pause and Roman they're both

296
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,629
grounded for one week after this could

297
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:31,959
