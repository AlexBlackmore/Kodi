supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you could use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

416
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,470
turn for something like co-stars here

417
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,028
but what you're supposed to do is when

418
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,950
somebody does something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> double down</font>

419
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:23,378
using some of your strength on our the

420
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,028
month but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the only thing you</font>

421
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:28,089

currently meditating yeah or or I could

423
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:33,819
just make just<font color="#E5E5E5"> meditate to license my</font>

424
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:36,368
twice is fucking being able to see

425
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:38,138

426
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:43,048
uncover something incredibly profound

427
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:45,278
easy or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll give co6 turns yeah</font>

439
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:25,388

00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:28,479
isn't interrupted that's the crazy run

441
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:31,269
to the entrance from here do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

442
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,499
wants in a second try he can do whatever

443
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:37,210
he wants dead bones and Roman dead bones

444
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:40,269
you don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a turn anymore</font>

445
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:43,829
you can control the necromancer but

446
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:46,659
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> he works much differently um</font>

447
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:48,490
honestly the necromancer probably isn't

448
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:50,019
going to move the necromancerr all he

449
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,579
wants to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> control the dead he's</font>

450
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:53,589
probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try even harder to</font>

451
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:55,210
control you can try even harder to

452
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:57,730
control the day yeah he's gonna just try

453
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,139
and overpower the young he's gonna prove

like work with the Goblin something is

506
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:20,629
fucked up with dead bones like both your

507
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:21,949
brothers are obviously in tired are

508
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,750
freaking out

509
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,250
I mean if you if you want you can run

510
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,528
under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sink that you are completely</font>

511
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,359
panicking that's fine all your other

512
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:32,329
brothers are panicked you can do that

513
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,859
but you can't actively just be like fuck

514
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:36,470
justin you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it for the</font>

515
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:42,949
reason of panic wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have i have a</font>

516
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:45,740
theory uh-huh I'm staying<font color="#E5E5E5"> here long</font>

517
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,480
coming up your way you're walking up to

518
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,450
the scale I'm doing this let him do it

519
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this is</font>

520
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,960
what I even<font color="#CCCCCC"> went up close to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them they</font>

521
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:56,869
didn't actually attack me they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

522
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,259
shot arrows at me<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking I have this</font>

523
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:02,778
theory that there is my turn all right

524
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:05,148
the skeletons run past pause they don't

525
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:08,679
see him as an enemy probably has

526
00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:11,778
<font color="#CCCCCC">something to do with his vampire blood I</font>

527
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:17,210
was hoping you would just stay get

528
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:21,079
trapped the skeletons run past they

529
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,399

547
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,009
crystal before you can kind of like
