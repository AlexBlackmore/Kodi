221
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,529

bullshit quest to go slay some things

810

weapons and giving you proper weapons

812
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:02,950

856
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,760
resolution but I was ok with the

857
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,170
resolution you guys had it<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't</font>

858
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,180
beating the dungeon but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font>

859
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,700
as long as there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolution</font>

860
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:54,338
that's fine but we'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

861
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:56,710
we'll have to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out ways to I guess</font>

862
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:59,710
I'll to figure out ways to put our human

863
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:03,068
dungeon yeah well Bart for continuing

864
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:05,710
campaigns yeah not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really much you can</font>

865
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:07,989
do yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we might have the I think</font>

866
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,789
while it would be nice to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do</font>

867
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,279
multiple campaigns I think we ought to

868
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:13,960
just play it out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes we might</font>

869
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,960
have decide it just has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

870
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,730
just the show must go on or fewer people

871
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,019
will probably do for you yeah well<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

872
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be a little be a smaller will have</font>

873
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:23,288
to do tests with fewer people and things

874
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,180
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see how it works but I</font>

875
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:26,890
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have something really fun that</font>

876
