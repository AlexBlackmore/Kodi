9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,189
effect fashion with mushrooms she

10
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,799

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,730
tripping balls but the mushrooms kind of

19
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,279
just have like an counteractive effect

20
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,619
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> justin's poisons questions are much</font>

21

won't be able to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the other two</font>

35
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,109
mermaids but you suspect because you've

36
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,189
seen what Justin's mushrooms can do that

37
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,129
even though you don't have the proper

38
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,269
materials to make this great disguise

39
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:44,429
you think you can play it off and

40
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:48,420
convince this this girl that you're also

41
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,090

45
00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:01,259
Jake<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to just randomly try to</font>

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,990
rub tails with the mermaids mermaids no

47
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,750
almost mermaids do not like rubbing your

48
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:10,439
tails she kind of finds it quite odd but

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,729
she's starting to trip so she<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

50
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,770
really know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make of it she's</font>

462
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,200
change which can be anchored to a third

463
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,750
so you're both mermaids to pause both

464
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,590
mothers to pause pause is the anchor

465
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:27,660
yeah all right um remember you can break

466
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:29,759
you'll be able to break these chains at

467
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,420
any time if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say no if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

that all right both of these bland

476
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:59,430
mermaids are now chained to pause um and

477
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:02,639
those chains cannot be broken and any

478
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:04,620
damage dealt them yeah Stan the mermaids

481
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,539
the honor chain you can tell that doing

482
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,040
something would hurt so if they attack

483
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:13,559
pause in any way they would be hurting

484
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,149
themselves if any way but remember if

tail slapping was there anything other

560
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,819

don't know but jqj Kenny we're gonna

562
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:46,559
roll for Jake's knowledge of what he

563
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:49,769
learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the mermaids when he was</font>

564
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:54,690
tail flipping them oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow all</font>

spritz and Jake's knowledge of mermaid

567
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:59,940
he actually has studied these in the

568
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,859
past that's why he was so originally

569
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,529
attracted to him he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just always wanted</font>

570
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:07,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be with the mermaid it's his lifelong</font>

571
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:11,730
goal in some ways to mate with a mermaid

572
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:14,369
mermaids do have small compartments

573
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:18,120
where they keep their eggs located<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

574
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:19,589
front in a very squishy area mermaids do

575
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,989
not accuse do not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a blowjob</font>

576
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:23,490
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mermaid they can't really control</font>

577
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,759
the poison<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their mouth really well it</font>

578
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:30,359
would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pleasant it would just burn</font>

579
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:34,559
mermaids do not have buttholes they poop

580
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:38,189
another mouth what was nothing each

581
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:43,889
other kissing me to fuck you that don't

582
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:46,620
do happen so do anything Jake Daly

583
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,759
military now Jake does all this jake are

584
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:50,909
you gonna share this information with

585
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:53,190
your friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I have no choice I mean</font>

586
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,920
those those definitely aren't gills as

587
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,660
loud at first no so the only really

588
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,060
thing are the shells by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way Jake was</font>

589
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,529
right they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even come off they look</font>

590
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,940
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like like little booby</font>

591
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:05,420
things they're actually part of the

592
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:09,120
mermaids body Jake was right originally

593
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,800
still get a shell job I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you</font>

594
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,289
can't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you're really two</font>

595
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,299
shells push against your wiener this is

596
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:20,769
some pretty broad there's a tiny bit of

597
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:23,209
skin I mean have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you relished</font>

598
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:26,419
season<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to rub my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dick against all</font>

599
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:27,889
Jake knows that is what's Jake Jake's

600
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:30,559
now basically shared all this

601
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:32,778
information and I would assume Jake your

602
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:36,138
best bet<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be to let the mermaids go</font>

603
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:38,898
and but Jake does mention that cooked

604
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:42,978
mermaids are very very tasty we got food

605
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:46,488
they wait they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cod so I can also</font>

606
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:49,308
mention um what I suggest is that we

607
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:52,219
take them along with us and swing them

608
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:53,898
on the chains and then whisper penis

609
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:55,459
just the right moment so then they

610
00:26:53,898 --> 00:26:57,378
become projectile what no I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

611
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:59,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">that idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna keep himself or you</font>

612
00:26:57,378 --> 00:27:01,038
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of keeping them yeah I</font>

613
00:26:59,088 --> 00:27:02,628
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep them as pets I'm really</font>

614
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,608
named them they have names guys you

615

00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:08,528
no problem maintaining this now but when

617
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:11,659
