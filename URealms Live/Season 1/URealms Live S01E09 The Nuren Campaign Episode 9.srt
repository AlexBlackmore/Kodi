prepare them in case you guys decide to

18
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,039

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,070
play for<font color="#E5E5E5"> another two hours that is like</font>

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,260
my hard limit I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just at that point I</font>

25
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,769
won't be able to uh that's when I take

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,799
obtained my dming Oh cat oh that's evil

27
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,390
that's your the worse so I wrap it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,159
takes a long time to try to fuck a

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,560
mermaid no well you know what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it really is too is this is more</font>

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,759
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> than we would normally would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,570
we had a full eight person roster and so

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,150
when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go around the table</font>

34
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:29,039
eight times you know in anything it's

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,299
obviously always going to take much

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer than if we had to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around for</font>

37
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is we're going to pretty much plan</font>

38
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,200
to do like five people shows maybe six

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,359
with a guest now well we'll probably do

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,549
something five or six but at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

41
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,569
time I mean this this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just how I was</font>

42
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,860
going to eventually be sometimes

43
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,209
sometimes we're going to have long games

44
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,759
sometimes we're going too fast games

45
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:49,559
nature of D&amp;D I think the Indians are

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,049
still going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this day is it the</font>

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,310
nature D&amp;D when we burn down a tavern we

48
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:59,430
insulted oh come<font color="#CCCCCC"> on let's win this you</font>

49

<font color="#E5E5E5">know no no no you gotta be honest though</font>

50
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:06,570
Aaron played D&amp;D like exactly the way

51
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,340
like anyone who's never played D&amp;D would

52
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,538
play like the first thing you do is come

53
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,610

79
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:11,068
of very very silliness and fun plot like

80
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,769
right now we're where we at we got paws

81
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:16,560
he's still large<font color="#E5E5E5"> two mermaids chained</font>

82
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and mermaids like we're discussing what</font>

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,709
to do with the moment yeah we're at a

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,509
comment the mermaids are not attacking

85
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,979
all right away Hiro hold on let me let

86
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:28,378
me describe it so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get back in</font>

87
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:30,238
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so combat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ended okay romina</font>

88
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:33,689
Devlin's of stops printing they're no

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,099
longer worried pause is still enlarged

90
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:38,128
but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off in the next</font>

91
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:40,619
couple minutes pause you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two</font>

92
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:42,030
mermaids who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> too fucking dumb you</font>

93
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,150
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two mermaids who are very</font>

94
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,030
docile towards you there at this point

95
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,829
they're just scared for their life

96
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,739
they're chained to pause via the honor

97
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,870
change which can only be broken if Roman

98
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,480
cuz Roman is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paladin whispers the</font>

99
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,519
word penis whispers penis<font color="#E5E5E5"> Egan since the</font>

100
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,108
whisper as to with it and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

101
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,629
whisper it has to be in character as

102
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">well so but basically we whispers being</font>

103
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it they break he would never betray</font>

104
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,540
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do that it's the chains effect</font>

105
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,340
make it so if anybody hurts pause or

106
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,408
anybody hurts the mermaids the other

107
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,209
will get hurt so if you punch a mermaid

108
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:16,709
pause gets punched if you punch pause

109
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,569
the mermaid sea a punch so the permits

110
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,879
the mermaids kind of know this the honor

111
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,399
trains to just when you get hit you just

112
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,228
kind of know the rules of it maybe

113
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,709
they've known about it before maybe one

114
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:28,899
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pallet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and who knows</font>

115
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:31,359
but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the effects so they are</font>

116
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:33,519
just now completely obedient to pause

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,650
but the same time they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> loyal in</font>

118
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,689
any way they're just chained to him and

119
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:40,179
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the threat of what happens when</font>

120
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:42,430
pause is no longer enlarged here he'll

121
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,019
be fine so we're at a combat you guys

122
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,000
can discuss what to do with the mermaids

123
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:49,269

the ogres not too happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so at</font>

507
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:37,668

he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and throw you off um he's</font>

509
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:42,110
not successful but in the process he

510
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:44,058
does throw a mermaid who still changed

511
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:47,689
you Lance right next on the ground and

512
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:49,490
you take one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking god same with</font>

513
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:53,360
the mermaid also the way this mermaid

514
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,919
landed she like broke one of the bones

515
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,229
and her fingers and she's now kind of

516
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,720
crying in pain don't break the mermaids

517
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,759
pause yeah you broke her pinky so do

518
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,259
what the ogre did that yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

519
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,650
that damage<font color="#E5E5E5"> King I'm trying to stop him</font>

520
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:11,140
he's an asshole damn

521
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:13,750
um so the the two mermaids are the two

522
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,330
mermaids get together here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

523
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,960
like flopping around they both start

524
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:21,669
shooting acid at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ochre because at</font>

525
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,950
this point they're tied to pause they

526
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,420
have no choice they just see this ogre

527
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,039
they know this auger could back up and

528
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,779
kill them they just immediately try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

529
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:35,170
start shooting this ogre in the face see

530
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:37,019
welcome it's a defense mechanism the

531
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,759
ogre takes a little bit of damage and

532
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:42,129
inherently so does pause and the mermaid

533
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,440
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Honor chains and then the</font>

534
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:49,840
second mermaid shoots acid at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ogre</font>

535
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,910
and again does a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of damage</font>

536
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,429
which also affects pause pause your

537
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:57,250
