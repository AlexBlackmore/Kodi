there is nothing more I need to know about Alex Jones.

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,786

00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:49,281
that is not happening, just imagine how upset

21
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,984

22
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,152

00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,020

But, unfortunately, it is an important part

of a lot of people's media diets.

50

has tweeted content from Infowars and one of its editors

So tonight, we are going to do that,

92
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,393
and let's first set aside the key context,

93
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,427
that Alex Jones has repeatedly used his show

94
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:51,864
to fuel speculation that the Sandy Hook Massacre

95
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:54,832
was staged by the government, which has been deeply hurtful

96
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,669
for the parents of those children over the years.

97
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,705
That is disgusting and should be disqualifying

98
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,807
in terms of ever taking him seriously.

99
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:04,409

100
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:05,877
from being taken seriously,

101
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:08,413

you may be less aware of

104
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:15,554
and that concerns the nature of Jones' show itself.

105
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:17,488
It is four hours long,

106

107

your most shocking discovery might be how frequently

108
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,596

00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:20,105
And the reason I know that is we bought a whole bunch.

177
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,407
Now, let me break them down for you.

178
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:26,377
There is a Super Male Vitality, a Super Female Vitality,

179
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,948
"Wake Up America Patriot Blend" coffee, Lung Cleanse,

180
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:33,117
Brain Force Plus, something called DNA Force

181
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,588
that cost 120 dollars a bottle,

182
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:39,757
and Child Ease, a herbal blend, which, according to Infowars,

183
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:43,161
is "designed to sooth the mind and bodies of children"

184
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,898
which is a profoundly, creepy phase.

185
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:50,968
And then, there is Caveman True Paleo Formula with bone broth,

186
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:55,741
a chocolate flavored drink mix, made from bee pollen, stevia

187
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,908
and the dust of chicken skeletons.

188
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:01,948
Now, according to Infowars, it is one of the most popular

189
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,550
new health trend in the world today.

190
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:07,185
And by the look on Jones' face, it tastes

191
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,321
exactly as good as it sounds.

192
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,322
You pour that in on a couple of ice cubes.

193
00:08:11,555 --> 00:08:12,724
And folks, it tastes...

194
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,728
when it's creamy and thick, I think, better than Ovaltine.

195
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:19,598
And it has got all the bone broth and so much more.

196
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:22,367
This is why, the ancients, they believe were--

197
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,568
had such better bones,

198
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:24,870
were so much healthier, you can look it up.

199
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,106
This-- you could freeze this and this will be better

200
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,208
than, like, bluebell chocolate ice cream.

201
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,543
Mm!

204
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:41,019
that Alex Jones did not enjoy drinking that glass of Caveman.

205
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,523
Because, I have got a glass of Caveman, right here.

206
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:47,225

I decided to do this 'cause I haven't done this

218
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:18,289

00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,937
The only thing I can discern happened

225
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:33,239
between those two photos

226
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,807
is that you walked shirtless in the sun for two hours

227
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,108
to a belt store.

228
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:40,278
You-- you could flip those two photos around

229
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,916
and the effect would be exactly the same. Also...

230
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:50,588
And look, to be fair to Jones, he does have a medical expert,

231
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:52,457
who consults on many of his supplements,

232
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:55,660

he does not have an undergraduate degree.

he only completed a non-degree certificate program there,

00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,538
It'll kill you!

350
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,176
Woah! Wow! I honestly did not know

351
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,910
that you could imply your competition kills people.

352
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,748
Four out of five dentists prefer Trident gum

353
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:45,449
and the fifth dentist is dead because he put a piece

354
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:48,753
of Wrigleys in his mouth and that's basically suicide!

355
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,425
And to hear Jones tell it... to hear Jones tell it,

356
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:54,826
his products are marked up

357
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,728
just enough to keep his business going.

358
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:58,929
As he explained in his recent appearance on,

359
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,232
<i> Rationalizing Low Ratings</i> with Megyn Kelly.

360
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,268
It may cost 45, 50 million dollars a year, around that.

361
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,471
How much money is being made?

362
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:07,572
Well, the money that's made

363
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:08,907
is pretty much put back into things.

364
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,076
Okay, so that is remarkable for two reasons.

365
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:16,148
First, 45 to 50 million dollars is a lot of money.

366
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,317
And second, Jones would have you believe

367
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,686
that every penny they earn is being plowed back

368
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,986
into a show that looks like it was filmed on the set

369
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:25,658
of a low-budget porn parody of itself.

370
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,994
In fact, as he frequently tells is audience,

371
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,329
he needs them to buy more to keep

372
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,899
his truth telling crusades solvent and growing.

373
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:35,600
JONES:<i>  We need to fund ourselves,</i>

374
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,502
<i> and we find ourselves  by you buying the products.</i>

375
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:39,605
We're at a shortfall now because of the massive,

376
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:42,740
sustained economic attacks we're under, but the listeners

377
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,808
in just two weeks have almost narrowed that gap.

378
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:46,611
I could have to sell my house...

379
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,014
to keep this place running three, four months.

380
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,882
I could have sponsors every segment.

381
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,150
I don't do it. I plug enough to fund things.

382
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,821
Fund us, give me the energy

383
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,489
and I will attack the enemy.

384
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:00,658
Exactly! It's like an NPR pledge drive

385
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,663
for people who hate NPR. Because to listen to Jones,

386
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,566
Infowars is perpetually on the edge of disaster.

387
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:09,567
He even has a link on the Infowars store,

388
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,470
where you can just give him money,

389
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,805
to help fund the fight against tyranny.

390
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:15,940
And contributors have left comments like,

391
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,575
"Twenty-five dollars may not be much,

392
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,443
but I know every little bit helps."

393
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,480
But Jones seems to be doing a bit more

394
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,516
than just keeping his head above water.

395
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,052
Ex-employees describe a thriving business

396
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,487
with one saying, "He can sell 500 supplements

397
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,256
in an hour... It's like QVC for conspiracy."

398
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,793
And in one of those clips we showed earlier,

399
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,896
we noticed he's wearing what looks like a Rolex watch

400
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,097
worth around 8000 dollars.

401
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,799
Which... cool.

402
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,001
And, y'know, as we looked around,

403
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:47,471
we noticed he also seems to have another two different Rolexes.

404
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,173
And you know... cooler.

405
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,442
And here's the thing, that is honestly fine.

406
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:53,977
He can have fancy watches.

407
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,447
There is nothing wrong with him getting paid.

408
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,383
I get paid to make this show.

409
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:00,384
But it does fight with his message

410
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:02,321
that he needs you to buy products

411
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:05,656
to help keep his show going. And even Alex Jones

412
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:07,058
seems to be a little self-conscious

413
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,326
about that disconnect.

414
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,528
But don't worry, he's reconciled it

415
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,563
in a truly amazing way.

416
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:15,933
I wear a blue sports coat and a Rolex

417
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,869
because it's a symbol of middle-class

418
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:21,840
and humanity having prosperity and promoting human prosperity

419
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,976
for respect of empowering humanity

420
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,711
and stealing the image of a man in a sports jacket

421
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,379
with a Rolex, that is the satanic image.

422
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,084
So, I dress as a Satanist,

423
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,886
so that I can enter their world and show you

424
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,454
that none of it means anything.

425
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,889
Oh bullshit!

426
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:42,026
How stupid do you think your audience is?

427
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:43,595
Okay, you bought a Rolex

428
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:45,329
so you could dress up like a Satanist.

429
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,264
What are the other two for?

430
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,969
And incidentally tormenting the parents of Sandy Hooke

431
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,538
should comfortably get you into the satanic club.

432
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,173
I believe that's the easy pass to whatever hell's version

433
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,741
of the champagne room is.

434
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,810
And look, so, at the start of this piece,

435
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:02,246
I promised Alex Jones that I would put his statements

436
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,648
in context, because he is right

437
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,951
that if you place small clips in isolation,

438
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,318
he looks like a loon.

439
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,823
But if you play them in context,

440
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,959
he looks like a skilled salesman spending hours a day

441
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:17,394
frightening you about problems like refugees spreading disease

442
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,131
and then selling you an answer.

443
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,833
Remember that gay frog clip at the start?

444
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,135
He did a follow-up show, explaining how chemicals

445
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,005
were being placed in the water to feminize society

446
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,206
and reduce the population,

447
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,642
and then immediately segued to this...

448
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:34,479
We shell five different brands of the very best water--

449
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,148
<i> water filtration systems  out there.</i>

450
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:38,849
<i> They're amazing,  they cut out 99.99 percent</i>

451
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,718
<i> of the glyphosate,  the herbicides,</i>

452
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,186
<i> the pesticides, the fluoride.</i>

453
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:45,322
I mean to an untrained eye, it sure seems like

454
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:47,392
he was using the idea of a gay frog

455
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:50,728
to sell his products, which, incidentally is the same mistake

456
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,830
-the WB network made. -(CROWD LAUGHING)

457
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:57,702
And-- and listen, listen! I'm not saying-- I'm not saying

458
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,338
the only reason Jones is talking about the globalist,

459
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,306
systematically feminizing us,

460
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:03,975
is to sell over-priced nutraceuticals

461
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,812
so he can buy luxury watches, but if I were saying that,

462
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,548
it certainly wouldn't be the stupidest conspiracy theory

463
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:11,215
that you've heard so far, tonight.

464
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,486
So, if Alex Jones wants his words in context,

465
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,721
this is it.

466
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,157
The fact that he happens to sell so many solutions

467
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,093
should really re-contextualize how you think

468
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,328
about what he is claiming are problems.

469
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,132
Think about it like this. How would you feel,

470
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:29,567
if at the end of this segment that may well have made you

471
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:33,437
feel a little dirty, I tried to sell you something

472
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:38,108
to wipe that gross feeling away? Would you question my motives?

473
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,211
Well, I certainly hope not,

474
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,513
because that's what we are doing right now.

475
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,480
(CROWD CHEERING)

476
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:47,085
Come with me. Come with me because I'm proud to say

477
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:50,254
that we've been working with a leading medical expert,

478
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,355
and I would like you to meet him right now.

479
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,427
Please, please welcome Doctor Ted Group III.

480
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,528
-(CROWD CHEERING) -Doctor Ted.

481
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,630
Ah, so happy to be here.

482
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:03,401
We-- we're so happy to have you, doctor.

483
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:08,306
A-- and we are-- we are here, the doctor and I, to offer you

484
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:11,842
the John Oliver Moisture Armored Tactical Assault Wipe.

485
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:15,747
The first tactical wipe for use, exclusively,

486
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:16,681
on the perineal.

487
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,249
That's right. Uh, for goodness sake,

488
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:23,187
don't use this anywhere else. You're gonna wanna just focus...

489
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,824
-Right. -...on this area right here.

490
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:27,491
-JOHN: OK. -DOCTOR: Right here.

491
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:30,628
Now... now... now Doctor,

492
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:34,164
Doctor, how is this going to make people feel better

493
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:36,134
about what they've seen tonight? How...

494
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:39,436
Well my studies show that when you vigorously apply

495
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,706
this taint wipe, it causes a sensation

496
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:44,674
that distracts the brain from whatever it had previously

497
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:45,944
-been thinking about. -(CROWD LAUGHING)

498
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:50,182
OK, and again, you've got degrees from MIT,

499
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:51,883
and everywhere else, and a bunch of other degrees.

500
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,951
The media makes fun of you and says that you're an idiot.

501
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,587
-They do. -(CROWD LAUGHING)

502
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,290
Just-- just for the record, you did go to MIT, right?

503
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,759
Well I've definitely physically been there.

504
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,195
That's... that's essentially the same.

505
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,297
That's what I've been telling everybody.

506
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:09,500
Now-- now you can actually buy one of these wipes

507
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,471
at infowipes.com for one million dollars.

508
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:16,340
This is real. They are actually available

509
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,808
for a million dollars apiece,

510
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,078
and don't even think about buying a similar wipe

511
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,481
in a store, because those wipes will kill you.

512
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,217
Yeah, also, these wipes have the power

513
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:28,353
to heterosexualize frogs.

514
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,354
So uh, that's very nice to have,

515
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:31,955
'cause that's been a real problem

516
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:34,325
-what with all the refugees. -(CROWD GROANS AND LAUGHS)

517
00:21:34,424 --> 00:21:37,794
And look-- look, this tactical taint wipe has demonstrated

518
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,230
incredible results, hasn't it, Doctor?

519
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,597
Absolutely, it sure has.

<i>And now look at this photo of me  forty-five minutes later...</i>

00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,175
You-- you're much redder there.

524
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,079
-I'm so much redder! -So much redder!

525
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,913
-So disturbingly red! -So much...

526
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,549
So, if you want to spend a million dollars

527
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,319
on a taint wipe, go to infowipes.com,

528
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:03,388
and if you're thinking, "Well, no one's going to do that,"

529
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,225
all I will say is, people pay Alex Jones 45 dollars

530
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,427
for a jar of chocolate flavored chicken juice,

531
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,630
so anything is fucking possible.
