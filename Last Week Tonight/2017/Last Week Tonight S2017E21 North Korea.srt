JOHN OLIVER: North Korea... America's number one excuse

2
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:07,506
for putting off chores this week.

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:09,775
"Y'know, I could do laundry, but if the world's

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:13,012
about to erupt into nuclear war, what really is the point?"

5
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,045
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

6
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:16,948
North Korea has clearly been on everyone's minds this week,

7
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:18,317
and I think you know why.

8
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,287
President Trump and North Korea escalate the war of words,

9
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,590
lobbing new threats and sending new tweets.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,359
North Korea now accusing the president of the United States

11
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:31,864
of pushing the world to, quote, "the brink of nuclear war."

12
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:36,402
Wow. When Twitter was invented, I bet even they

13
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:39,138
didn't imagine that it would one day lead us to the brink

14
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:40,906
-of nuclear Armageddon. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

15
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:43,074
It's like if the invention of the Furby had led

16
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:45,110
-to the Sudanese civil war. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,146
Who knew that that's where it was headed?

18
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:48,246
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

19
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:50,483
Now, tensions have sharply escalated this week,

20
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:52,417
which is a little surprising, given that the world

21
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:53,953
has been dealing with North Korea's

22
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:56,021
provocative missile tests for years now.

23
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,024
Just two weeks ago, they were doing this.

24
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,225
CORRESPONDENT:<i> North Korea fires  yet another missile,</i>

25
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,594
<i> but Pyongyang claims this one</i>

26
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,195
<i> will be able to hit the  U.S. mainland,</i>

27
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,798
<i> striking cities like  Los Angeles, Denver,</i>

28
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:10,201
<i> Chicago, and possibly even  New York and Boston.</i>

29
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:13,772
Wait! New York? I live in New York!

30
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,176
-This shit just got real! -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

31
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,977
No, I think if anyone is-- if everyone is really honest,

32
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,514
your level of fear over the North Korea situation

33
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,448
is in direct proportion to whether or not

34
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,450
they can hit the exact place where you live.

35
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:26,284
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

36
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:28,487
We film this show on 57th street.

37
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:31,790
If you told me that the blast radius stops at 56th street,

38
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,960
I'd think, "Well, I hope nothing happens,

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,662
but we've still got time before things get serious."

40
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:37,730
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

41
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,334
-Now, it is-- it is worth properly understanding -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

42
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:43,969
what North Korea is currently capable of,

43
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,204
because while their missiles may be able to reach us

44
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,407
and they do have nuclear warheads,

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,677
most experts believe that they don't yet have the technology

46
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,947
to reliably hit the U.S. mainland,

47
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:57,417
so that is reassuring. Although, on the other hand

48
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,186
a recent Pentagon assessment did suggest that they could cross

49
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,820
that threshold next year.

50
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,291
So, if a job interviewer asks you, "Where do you see yourself

51
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,492
in five years' time?"

52
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:09,628
It is now perfectly acceptable just to scream in terror

53
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,831
-into their face. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

54
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:15,335
Look, this is clearly a very serious situation,

55
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,801
requiring a deft hand.

56
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:19,604
And, sadly, that's not what it got.

57
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,210
North Korea best not make any more threats

58
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,611
to the United states.

59
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:30,516
They will be met with fire and fury,

60
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,718
like the world has never seen.

61
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:38,424
"Fire and fury." The only way that that is not terrifying

62
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:41,426
is if you report it the way one newspaper actually did in Maine

63
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:44,363
saying, "Trump warns of fire and furry."

64
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:45,431
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

65
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,001
In which case, Trump was threatening to send this

66
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,403
to North Korea, which is a very different kind of threat.

67
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,906
Now-- now, in response, North Korea announced plans

68
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:58,611
to fire missiles that would land just off the coast of the U.S. territory of Guam,

69
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,381
which is frightening, although not unprecedented.

70
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,650
They have made similar threats before.

71
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,887
But what is different this time, obviously, is that we now have

72
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:11,022
a president who has the general temperament of a wet cat.

73
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:13,725
And, in response to that Guam threat,

74
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:15,561
Trump promptly doubled down.

75
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:17,963
Frankly, uh, the people that were questioning

76
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,998
that statement, "Was it too tough?"

77
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:21,667
Maybe it wasn't tough enough.

78
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,903
If anything, that statement may not be tough enough.

79
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:28,407
Well, you'll see, you'll see.

80
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,911
"Yeah, we're gonna go with that bomb more destructive

81
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,112
than the nuclear bomb. Why? I don't know!

82
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,481
Who cares that it doesn't exist? Sincerely yours, Donald Trump.

83
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:38,616
I'm not writing a letter. I'm talking. Says you!

84
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:39,719
Fake news. Goodbye!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS)

86
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,489
So, tonight, we thought we would ask,

87
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,792
"What, exactly, is North Korea thinking?

88
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,794
How did we get into this mess?

89
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,596
And what can we possibly do about it?"

90
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:53,299
And let's start by trying to understand just a little bit

91
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,733
more about North Korea.

92
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:57,937
And that in itself is difficult. It's one of the most isolated

93
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,272
and insular nations on earth.

94
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,640
If you know anything about it at all, it's probably just that

95
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,110
they have a wacky totalitarian leader who loves

96
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,480
military parades and Dennis Rodman,

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,415
and who really didn't like that Seth Rogen movie

98
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:11,584
about his assassination.

99
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:13,318
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -And it can be hard

100
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,521
to trust any information about North Korea,

101
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:18,723
because lots of it is inaccurate for multiple reasons.

102
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:20,992
First, there's the outright state propaganda,

103
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:24,295
which glorifies North Korea's leaders, the Kim family.

104
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:27,599
Just last year, we showed you western journalists being taken

105
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,567
on a tour of a historic target range,

106
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,004
where they learned something suspiciously impressive

107
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:33,639
about Kim Jong-Un's father.

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,042
Comrade Kim Jong-il shot three bullets and three of them

109
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:38,142
got bulls-eye.

110
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,412
-They all got bulls-eye? -Mm-hmm.

111
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,548
-And how old was he at the time? -He was 7-year-old.

112
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:43,482
A 7-year-old's got

113
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:44,849
-three bulls-eyes? -Mm-hmm. yeah.

114
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:47,752
-That's pretty impressive. -(LAUGHS) Mm-hmm.

115

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

116
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:52,724
I mean, that-- that is the "mm-hmm"

117
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,828
of someone who really wants to shut down a conversation.

118
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:58,264
She sounds like a parent fielding questions

119
00:04:58,363 --> 00:04:59,697
about where babies come from.

120
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:02,367
-"So, a stork brings the baby?" -"Mm-hmm."

121
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:05,437
"It carries an eight-pound baby through the air in its mouth?"

00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:06,537
"Mm-hmm."

-"Isn't that dangerous?" -"Mm-hmm."

00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,643
"Where does the stork get the babies?"

"Storks fuck! They fuck each other! Storks fuck each other,

126

and the baby comes out of the stork's vagina!

(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)

129
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,023
But, here's the thing.

130
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,093
Inaccuracies like that are easy to spot.

131
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:30,128
What is trickier is that a lot of eye-catching western

132
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:32,497
reporting about North Korea can be shakily sourced,

133
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,598
like this one.

134
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,102
JOY-ANN REID:<i> The BBC reports  all of the men in the  hermit kingdom</i>

"The haircut every man in North Korea must have."

139
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:50,915
Lucky them.

140
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:52,283
Here's the thing...

141
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,321
There is no solid evidence that that story is true.

142
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,189
But it is seductive because it sounds like it could be.

143
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,625
It's like if you saw the headline

144
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:01,794
"Trump to NATO: I invented Squirrels."

145
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,663
You'd believe it because it sounds like something

146
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:08,266
he would've claimed, even though as of this taping, he has not.

147
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,970
And, while it may not be true that all men had to get

148
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,973
the same haircut as Kim Jong-un, state TV did run a series

149
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,475
called "Let Us Trim Our Hair in Accordance

150
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:18,877
with the Socialist Lifestyle."

151
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:23,182
And it's weird when a verifiable truth is almost as strange

152
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:24,282
as a wild rumor.

153
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:27,952
It's like how the "Richard Gere Put a Gerbil in His Ass" story

154
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:30,523
is completely false, but what if the truth

155
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:33,091
was that he engaged in consensual mutual anal play

156
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,295
with a chinchilla? That would still be bizarre.

157
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,497
You wouldn't have to exaggerate that.

158
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:41,733
And sometimes, the truth about life in North Korea

159
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,302
can be just as striking as the urban legends.

160
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,507
For instance, you may have seen claims online that every teacher

161
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,475
in North Korea is obligated to play the accordion.

162
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,177
We could not confirm that.

163
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:55,447
Although, in trying to, we did discover that North Korea

164
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:58,884
does love the accordion to a surprising extent.

165
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:02,487
The country is full of them. Here is an accordion factory.

166
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,890
Here's some schoolchildren playing the accordion.

167
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,158
Here's Kim Jong-un looking at an accordion.

168
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:10,161
Here is an air combat exercise where the camera pans

169
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,796
<i> across pilots, and guess what?</i>

170
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,301
<i>-Yep. It's a fucking accordion.</i> -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,608

You know what? If nothing else, we finally have our answer

349
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,046
to the decade-long question,

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

352
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:53,018
It turns out, it's all your mom's friends

353
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,753
and the people of North Korea.

354
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:58,055
And if you think about it, that is very dangerous

355
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,759
for Kim Jong-un, because if people get a sense

356
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,227
that the image of America that he has carefully painted

357
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,630
for them is false, he could have huge problems.

358
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,766
And, when you understand him in that light,

359
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:11,269
as a dictator desperately hedging against a loss of power,

360
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:14,239
it is possible to understand why all his recent threats

361
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,274
against the United States, have been reckless,

362
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,610
but in his mind, also rational.

363
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:21,312
And that brings us to the key question here,

364
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,181
what are we going to do about this?

365
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:25,282

They said, "Would you speak to the leader of North Korea?"

368
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:36,127
I said, "Absolutely. Why not? Why not?"

369
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,764
And they come out, "Trump would speak to him!"

-No! No! There really isn't. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

377
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,653
Partly because, remember, Kim Jong-un believes they are

378
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:04,789
critical for his survival, and on top of that,

379
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,492
Donald Trump is a shitty negotiator.

380
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:10,162
In his short presidency, he has failed to get Mexico

381
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:12,364
to pay for his stupid wall, he's failed to get

382
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:15,700
a Congress his party controls to pass a health care bill,

383
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,336
and even when his administration does get something done,

384
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:21,071
it way oversells it, like when the White House

385
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,173
announced a trade deal with China as,

386
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:26,911
"Very Big News," "Gigantic," and "Herculean,"

387
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,346
and one much-celebrated component turned out to be

388
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:32,750
lifting a ban on beef imports that China had preliminarily

389
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,553
agreed to last September.

390
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,921

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

395
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,267
And since taking office,

396
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:51,903
Trump has voiced support for an even simpler solution.

397
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:55,206
China... is helping us

So, in the space of 14 seconds there,

403
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,188
he said the word "great" twice,

404
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,057
he pronounced "China" with three syllables,

405
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,360
suggested someone else should do the work for him,

406
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,462
and then, threw in a "possibly or probably,"

407
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:19,932
rendering the whole thing meaningless.

(CROWD LAUGHS)

411
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:29,707
But Trump's idea there of convincing China

412
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:31,742
to exert influence on North Korea,

413
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:33,545
is not inherently crazy.

414
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,413
China shares an 800-mile border with North Korea

415
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:38,282
and accounts for as much as 90 percent

416
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,717
of North Korea's total trade,

417
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,419
so they do have significant leverage.

418
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,056
But, some are skeptical about just what China could,

419
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:46,557
or is willing to do.

420
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:49,760
Take sanctions. The U.N. have tried multiple rounds

421
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,965
of increasingly-harsh sanctions, but North Korea has always found

422
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,166
easy ways around them.

could get out of hand very fast.

459

North Korea would likely retaliate and they have

460
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,656
an estimated 8,000 pieces of heavy artillery stationed

461

just north of the DMZ, which is here.

462

own people and they are now currently goading each other

518
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:02,078
towards Armageddon.

519
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,815
Which is absolutely terrifying.

520
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,050
And I don't really have a solution to this.

521
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,120
But, part of me would love the chance, just the chance,

522
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,855
to speak directly to the North Korean people.

523
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:15,091
So, on the off chance that this show is smuggled

524
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:18,697
over their border on a USB drive crammed with<i> NCIS</i> episodes,

525
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:21,266
I would just like to say this,

526
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,001
-Hi, North Korea. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

527
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,870
You may be hearing some frightening rhetoric

528
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,771
from our president, but if it helps at all,

529
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:31,075
when our president says words, he doesn't necessarily mean

530
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:32,978
what those words mean.

531
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:35,180
It's very difficult to describe to you,

532
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,581
we're still trying to wrap our heads around it ourselves.

533
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,185
Really, it's our problem, except it is now kind of

534
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,285
your problem, too.

535
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:44,422
But I want to talk to you about some misconceptions because

536
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:47,257
we certainly have misconceptions about you, uh,

537
00:23:47,357 --> 00:23:50,227
but you should know, ideally,

538
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,097
that we are not remotely what your state propaganda implies, either.

539
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:57,735
We honestly do not spend our days plotting your destruction.

540
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:02,206
We spend them sharing cat memes and spinning fidgii,

541
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:05,509
and getting furiously angry about a singing boy

542
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,911
barely appearing in our favorite dragon show.

543
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:11,682
So, for what it's worth, I would like to give you,

544
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:14,017
the North Korean people, a sense of how America

545
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:15,452
is feeling right now, in a way that you might

546
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:16,621
understand and enjoy.

547
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,824
And, that is through the international language

548
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:20,090
of the accordion.

549
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:22,826
And I have some good news and some bad news, there.

550
00:24:22,926 --> 00:24:25,663
The bad news is, I do not play the accordion.

551
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,164
The good news is,

552
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,068
I know someone who plays it like a fucking angel.

553
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,104
Ladies and gentlemen, and the people of North Korea,

554
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,340
please welcome, Mr. "Weird Al" Yankovic!
