President Trump has famously made securing the border

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,884
a key priority for his administration,

7
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,785
most notably through his border wall,

8
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:21,786

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a rope.

15

"Go get me all the ropes."

19
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,048
And while that wall idea has received a lot of coverage,

20
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:51,284
it is by no means Trump's only border plan.

21
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,652
One of his more benign-sounding, but potentially

22
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,856
no less dangerous, ideas concerns the Border Patrol.

23
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:59,190
And first, let's be clear about who they are.

24
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,627
They are part of Customs and Border Protection.

25
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:04,429
They are not ICE, who you may know from immigration raids.

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,230
They're also not customs officers,

27
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:08,734
who you'll see at airports and border crossings,

28
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,971
nor are they the Borders Patrol, a group of vigilantes

29
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,873
who defend abandoned Borders bookstores from raccoons.

30
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:18,778
No, the Border Patrol are the people in green uniforms

31
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,447
who literally patrol the boundaries of our country.

32
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,948
There are around 20,000 of them.

33
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,752
But Trump, in an executive order,

34
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,288
has called for them to add five thousand more,

35
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,056
to tackle the many problems that he sees

36
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,490

In recent years, the number of Mexicans apprehended crossing the border

that show how difficult the job of a Border Patrol agent can be,

82
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:29,542
because in that moment, they are delivering aid

83
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:31,977

00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:33,846
they may be chasing down drug traffickers.

85
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:36,382
So, it's a mixture between humanitarian work

86

and law enforcement, and not everyone can do it.

88
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,356
to expand the Border Patrol by 25 percent so concerning,

89
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,626
because if you hire agents quickly and badly,

90
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:50,096
it can actually leave us much less safe

00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,163
Now, just think about that. Over half of CBP's applicants,

175
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,067
who had cleared the highest level of background check,

176
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,968
were found unsuitable for service.

177
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,403
And some of what they confessed to

178
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:52,805
was absolutely incredible.

179
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,473
One applicant admitted to smoking marijuana

180
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,810
twenty-thousand times in a ten-year period.

181
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,012
Kudos to that individual.

182
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:04,649
While another stated he had "no independent recollection

183
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,952
of the events that resulted in a blood-doused kitchen,"

184
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,688
and was "uncertain if he had committed any crime

185
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:12,557
during his three-hour blackout."

186
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,560
Which, I'm gonna go ahead and say,

187
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,196
yes, you did commit a crime, or at the very least,

188
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,599
you really fucked up a soufflé.

189
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,436
I mean, you fucked that thing up bad.

190
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,605
And the problems didn't stop once the new agents were hired,

191
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:30,810
because the training was also significantly cut back,

192
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,612
and that caused real issues, as one trainer revealed,

193
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:34,879
while, for some reason,

194
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,316
being disguised as an asthmatic scarecrow.

195
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:39,650
REPORTER:<i> We are disguising  the face and voice</i>

196
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,120
<i> of this veteran agent  and training instructor,</i>

197
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,423
<i>because of fears of retaliation.</i>

198
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:47,359
AGENT:

199
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,994
So, the standards were lowered?

200
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,230
AGENT:

201
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,733
-What is happening there? -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

202
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,236
He sounds like Jesse Ventura after swallowing one of those

203
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:01,473
novelty cow-voice noise makers.

204
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,776
And look, I know that it is really hard to pay attention

205
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,611
to what Robot Neil Young is saying there,

206
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:09,113
but it is genuinely worth listening

207
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,750
to where they cut corners.

208
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,918
REPORTER:<i> The source told us  Spanish-language classes</i>

209
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,921
<i> and physical training  were cut back.</i>

210
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,622
AGENT:

211
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,298
They cut back on Spanish and physical training,

212
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,534
so the new standards affected agents' ability

213
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:31,269
to talk to the people they caught

214
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,773
and their ability to catch the people they wanted to talk to.

215
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:38,110
Which seem like pretty essential facets of their job.

216
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,247
It's like if the training program at SeaWorld left out

217
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,914
putting on a wetsuit and systematically driving

218
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:45,717
carnivorous whales insane.

219
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,620
That's the whole job there!

220
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,288
Take them away, you're left with nothing else!

221
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,091
And consequently, as the ranks grew,

222
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,326
corruption and excessive force sky-rocketed

223
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,763
and misconduct became such a problem

224
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,699
that, at one point, the Border Patrol felt it needed

225
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,867
to issue a memo about the fact their agents

226
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:06,270
"were averaging two alcohol- related arrests per week,"

227
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,908
and some agents off-duty run-ins with the law

228
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,475
were even more spectacular.

229
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,577

The couple is suspected of being drunk and violent.

00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,158
(CHUCKLING) Wow!

236
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:29,394
Now, I should tell you, one agent was found guilty

237
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,796
of assaulting the woman who complained,

238
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,164
but both denied that anything sexual was happening,

239
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,634
and they were found not guilty of the sex act,

240
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:39,105
presumably because they were at Cirque du Soleil,

241
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,572
where everything looks like a sex act.

242
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,008
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -I'll show you.

243

This... is a sex act.

244
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:46,310
This is a sex act.

245
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,679
This is a wildly difficult sex act.

246
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:50,981
That is a bird person sex act.

247
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,418
And I have absolutely no idea what's happening there,

248
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,587
but I think it's the thing Steve Bannon is supposed to be good at.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND CLAPPING)

250
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,828
And things got-- things got more serious than that.

251
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,532
Since 2005, 77 agents were arrested or indicted

252
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,300
for corruption, and if you think about it,

253
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,735
Border Patrol agents are particularly attractive

254
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,038
to drug-traffickers.

255
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:15,374
Remember, they often work on their own,

256
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,408
patrolling the border,

257
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,143
which, as one journalist points out,

258
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,345
is a pretty potent recipe for trouble.

259
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:25,017
<i> One Border Patrol agent  can undo an incredible amount</i>

<i>Literally. Absolutely literally.</i>

264
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,496
Yeah! This is one of the only cases

265
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,298
where someone saying "a ton of drugs"

266
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,235
actually means a literal ton of drugs.

267
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:46,303
No, Kevin, you did not do "a ton of drugs,"

268
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,941
you took a Benadryl, you made out with a goldfish,

269
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,343
and you passed out with your head in the dishwasher.

270
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,178
Pull your life together.

271
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,382
And look, let me give you just a taste of the kind

272
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,050
of spectacular corruption involved.

273
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,586
Take Agent Joel Luna, who, it turned out,

274
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,923
had a brother in the Gulf Cartel and who was convicted

275
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,425
of engaging in organized crime

276
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:08,360
with some pretty striking evidence

277
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,961

284
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,118
It's hard to explain why your Border Patrol badge

285
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:37,021
is in a safe with cocaine, money and a cartel pistol.

286
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,021
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -Yeah.

287
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,658
That is really hard to explain.

288
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,726
I mean, the best I can do is, uh,

289
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,828
"My badge had a drug problem that it couldn't bear

290
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:46,764
to tell me about, so finally, it decided to shoot itself

291
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:48,099
with a gun that we found on a case,

292
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:49,900
planning to die surrounded by its money

293
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,303
because its views on death resemble those of Ancient Egyptians."

294
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,707
But even then, we are talking about a sentient police badge

295
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:58,375
with an interest in Egyptology, so you're already banking

296
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:01,312
on a pretty large suspension of disbelief there.

297
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,548
Oh, and you should know,

298
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:06,585
Luna was hired during the last recruitment surge.

299
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:09,020
And CBP will tell you what they told us,

300
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,990
that while some agents did disgrace the badge with corruption,

301
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,758
the vast majority did not.

302
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,860
Although, it is worth knowing that Tomsheck,

303
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:17,428
the Internal Affairs guy,

304
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:20,131
believes the problem is much bigger than they imply.

305
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:22,801
Mr. Luna is not one bad apple.

306
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:26,337
<i> He is part of  a raid of corruption</i>

307
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:31,543
<i> that exceeded that of  any other U.S. Federal  law enforcement agency.</i>

308
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,778
Okay, so it's less "one bad apple,"

309
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,414
than, "Oh, my God. That is a lot of bad apples."

310
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,551
Which, by the way, should really be the marketing theme

311
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,219
for red delicious apples.

312
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,721
"Red delicious apples...

313
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,923
Well, at least we got the 'red' part right!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

315
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,526
And it gets even worse.

316
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,793
Because remember, these agents have guns.

317
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:52,129
And some have made very bad decisions.

318
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,033
And you may have seen coverage of some of the tragic incidents.

<i> Joe Antonio Elena Rodriguez.</i>

325
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,216
They say their agents were threatened by somebody

326
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,351
throwing rocks on this side of the fence.

327
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,489
But standing here, the first thing you ask yourself

328
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:20,926
is, "Could a 16-year-old boy really threaten somebody

329
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,596
standing on top of what's at least a 20-foot cliff?

330
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,964
And on the other side of that fence?"

331
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,301
I mean, yeah. That does seem pretty unlikely.

332
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,235
And to explain why, tune in next week

333
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,272
when our main story will be "Gravity...

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -Now, so you know,

336
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:39,644
that case is still in the courts.

337
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:42,614
And agents can sometimes feel threatened by rock throwers,

338
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:46,018
but it is worth pointing out that a report which looked at 25 cases

339
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,954
where Border Patrol agents shot people who'd thrown rocks,

340
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:52,358
concluded that "too many cases do not appear to meet

341
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:54,158
the test of objective reasonableness

342
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,427

"Holy shit! You shot some people you should not have fucking shot at.

-Maybe don't do that as much." -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

346
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,174
Oh, and there is one more thing about the agent

<i> He was one of those persons hired by, uh, the Border Patrol</i>

349
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,185
<i> -during the surge.</i> -Of course he was.

350
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,887
And yet, despite all of these warning signs,

351
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,324
we are about to embark upon another ambitious

352
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:26,658
Border Patrol hiring surge.

353
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,793
And CBP will tell you not to worry about that,

354
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,797
that in recent years they've improved hiring and made reforms.

355
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,166
For instance, they've slightly increased transparency

356
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,100
and given agents more non-lethal weapons

357
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,336
like pepper spray guns,

358
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,004
as well as rewriting the use of force rulebook to,

359
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,874
and I quote, "prohibit the shooting of suspects

360
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,346
fleeing the scene who do not pose a threat to themselves or others."

361
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,879
And look, that is great,

362
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,415
although it does seem to be one of those rules

363
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,717
that you shouldn't have had to write down.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -If you went to a zoo,

365
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,523

366
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,692
"Please don't finger the armadillos,"

367
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,394
you would wonder what the fuck had happened

368

-before that sign went up. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CLAPPING)

369
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:09,701
But the problem is, many other reforms have not been made,

370
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,536
and it is hard to believe that they will be

371
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:14,338
now that President Gravy Drugs is in charge.

372
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,807
In fact, worryingly, there has already been talk

373
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,643
that hiring standards might drop again

374
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:20,778
with suggestions like a shorter polygraph,

375
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,514
or removing parts of the entrance exam.

376
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:28,086
And most frustratingly of all, there may be no reason for us to take this risk,

377
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:31,389
because a report from the Inspector General For Homeland Security

378
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,860
questions whether we even need 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.

379
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,462
And yet, Trump seems determined to do this anyway.

380

Who knows why?

381
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,168
There is a fairly good chance he only said 5,000

382
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,738

about the laws the Border Patrol have been given to enforce,

386

and I have plenty of feelings on that,

387
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,414
you do want the best possible people enforcing them,

388
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:59,717

if we are going to hire all these new people,

the very least we can do is be more careful this time around.

398

399
