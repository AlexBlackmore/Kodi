1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:05,471
Nuclear waste.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,407
The worst type of garbage for raccoons to get into.

3
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:11,243
Now, it's a substance that we all know is dangerous

4
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:12,778
thanks to movies like this.

5
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:15,849
NARRATOR:<i> They tormented him  until he had a horrifying</i>

6
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:18,518
<i> accident and fell into a bag  of nuclear waste.</i>

7
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:22,020
<i> Melvin became  The Toxic Avenger,</i>

8
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:25,824
<i> the first superhero born  out of nuclear waste.</i>

9
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:29,727
<i> -His face is so terrifying...</i> -(SCREAMS)

10
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:31,763
NARRATOR:<i> ...we can't show it to you now.</i>

11
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:34,165
<i> You'll have to see the movie  for yourself.</i>

12
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:38,003
Honestly, you really don't need to see the movie, 'cause...

13
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:40,338
his face isn't really that terrifying. This is it.

14
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,707
I mean it's bad, but its-- it's so ugly,

15
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:44,243
it's almost cute again.

16
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:46,778
It's like-- it's like someone melted a candle shaped

17
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:48,280
-like a pug. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

18
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,883
But-- but the point here is

19
00:00:49,982 --> 00:00:52,951
nuclear waste, the radioactive and toxic byproducts

20
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,054
from making nuclear energy and weapons is

21
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,457
a serious health hazard, and America has a lot of it.

22
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:02,561
ANCHOR:<i> There are more than  71,000 tons of nuclear waste</i>

23
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:05,331
<i> stranded  at the nation's 104 reactors.</i>

24
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:08,034
<i> Put all those  spent fuel rods together,</i>

25
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,870
<i> and you get a pile  as big as a football field</i>

26
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:12,638
<i> and more than 20 feet tall.</i>

27
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,506
Or you could put them in a pile as big

28
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:16,841
as two football fields and ten feet tall

29
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,477
or half a football field and 40 feet tall.

30
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:21,914
Or 20 football fields, one foot tall.

31
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:25,216
The point is, we have a lot of nuclear waste and it's very fun

32
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:26,718
-to play with. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

33
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,454
And look, that is just the waste from nuclear energy.

34
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,124
We also have more than 100 million gallons

35
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:34,692
of hazardous liquid waste from producing weapons.

36
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,597
And you may live closer to nuclear waste than you think.

37
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:41,099
One out of three Americas lives within 50 miles

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,734
of high level nuclear waste.

39
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:45,837
Some of which, like plutonium, is lethally dangerous,

40
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:49,075
and will be-- will be around for an incredibly long time.

41
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:52,243
NARRATOR:<i> Even microscopic  amounts of plutonium,</i>

42
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:54,012
<i> if ingested, are deadly.</i>

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,182
One of the characteristics of it is it has

44
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:57,816
an extremely long half-life.

45
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:00,786
Plutonium 239, for example, has a half life

46
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,855
of about 24,000 years.

47
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:06,625
It's true, 24,000 years and that just scratches the surface.

48
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:10,162
It takes ten half-lives for plutonium to become harmless

49
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:12,764
so that's 240,000 years.

50
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:16,536
A unit of time more commonly known as one English patient.

51
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:17,736
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

52
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:20,772
And as any adult with an American girl doll collection

53
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:22,941
eventually finds out, if you wanna keep something

54
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,843
around for a disturbingly long time, you have got to find

55
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:27,479
an appropriate place to put it.

56
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,783
"I cannot live with your murder dolls anymore.

57
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,386
Felicity stares at me while I sleep!

58
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:34,954
She stares at me!"

59
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,389
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, CHEERS) -"She stares unblinking!"

60
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:39,191
And look,

61
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:41,326
I'm not the first person to make this point.

62
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:43,295
Look at this news report from 1990.

63
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,097
NARRATOR:<i>  Almost half a century</i>

64
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,799
<i> after nuclear power  was harnessed,</i>

65
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:50,168
<i> there still is no agreement  on where to store the waste.</i>

66
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,604
<i> "We have built the house,"  said one critic,</i>

67
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:54,639
<i> "and forgotten the toilets."</i>

68
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:56,508
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -A home...

69
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,378
with no toilets. Or as a realtor selling a Brooklyn loft

70
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:02,115
is calling it right now, "artisanal composting."

71
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,416
Wait.

72
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:05,650
You're suggesting that I shit in that potted plant

73
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,920
while you and I both know that I will do that

74
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,955
'cause this is convenient to public transport,

75
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,824
and has both northern and eastern exposures.

76
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:13,091
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

77
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,361
But look, it-- it has been 27 years since that clip

78
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:19,230
and our country still doesn't have a nuclear toilet.

79
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,167
And that is our subject tonight.

80
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:24,002
Why do we not have a nuclear toilet?

81
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,438
And it's actually easy to understand how we got

82
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,940
into this situation. Because during World War Two,

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,409
we rushed to develop nuclear weapons because we were trying

84
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:32,377
to defeat the Nazis,

85
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,681
who, fun fact, pretty much all Americans agreed were bad

86
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,116
-at the time. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

87
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,585
Anyway, the-- the thing is,

88
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,722
we didn't really have a plan on what to do

89
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,623
with all the radioactive byproducts that we produced.

90
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:46,924
And this initially led us

91
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:49,295
to some mind-blowingly stupid solutions.

92
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,764
For instance, for years, we actually did this...

93
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:54,033
MAN:<i> They loaded the, uh,</i>

94
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:58,704
radioactive waste and it was in barrels, 55 gallon barrels,

95
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:03,075
of, uh, radioactive waste with concrete poured over it.

96
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,343
It's funny, the ocean don't glow out there

97
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:08,546
outside of Red Bank, New Jersey. (CHUCKLES)

98
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,950
Really. 'Cause we dumped a lot of barrels out there.

99
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:13,985
-(AUDIENCE GASPS) -That is true.

100
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,389
We didn't just dump barrels of radioactive waste

101
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,190
in the ocean, we did it off the coast of New Jersey.

102
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,359
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

103
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,961
That is so horrifying!

104
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,497
I'm surprised that<i> Jersey Shore</i> was the title of a lighthearted

105
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,401
MTV series, and not the name of a harrowing documentary.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,637
An entire generation of children was born without thumbs,

107
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,539
a phenomenon known to locals as...

108
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,474
-"The Situation." -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

109
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,043
And, incidentally,

110
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:41,947
not all of those barrels sank. In fact, in 1957,

111
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:44,550
when two barrels were caught floating off the shore,

112
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:47,185
naval aircraft were summoned to strafe them

113
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,655
with machine-gun fire until they sank.

114
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:50,588
That's right.

115
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,625
They shot barrels full of nuclear waste

116
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,259
with machine guns!

117
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:57,262
That's got to be one of the most terrifying sentences ever said

118
00:04:57,362 --> 00:04:58,598
out loud, right after,

119
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,231
"Donald Trump is the president now,"

120
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:03,134
and, "Wait, wasn't Felicity on a different shelf

121
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,836
when we went to bed last night?

122
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,107
Oh, my God! Felicity is a waking nightmare!"

123

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

124
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,143
Oh!

125
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:14,780
Well, the truth is, tossing barrel-fulls of nuclear waste

126
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,214
into the ocean and shooting them

127
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:18,750
with machine guns is actually preferable to at least

128
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,853
one genuine other idea that was thankfully rejected,

129
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,023
and that was blasting it into space.

130
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,259
A concept with a pretty clear flaw.

<i> If any one of them blew up,</i>

<i>that would basically contaminate</i>

<i> a large portion of the Earth  with radioactive material.</i>

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Yeah.

140
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,286
You're right. That's probably not a great idea.

141
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,257
I mean, a really great idea would be also filling

142
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,225
the rockets up with confetti, so at least that way

143
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:03,428
if there's a horrific accident, there's also a party!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

145
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,067
Now, over the years, we have dumped nuclear waste all over

146
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,236
the country and in many places, there've been frightening leaks.

147
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:13,772
Take the Savannah River Site in South Carolina,

148
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:16,007
where waste from poorly-stored material leaked

149
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:17,009
into the ground water.

150
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,777
And just watch this alarmingly laid back man explain

Radioactive alligators!

160
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:40,833
They even have names,

161
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,134
Tritagator and Dioxinator,

162
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,436
after two of the wastes that poisoned them.

163
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:46,471
And that's actually very clever,

164
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,307
because if I had to give them names,

165
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,009

00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:05,925
an area in North St. Louis County, Missouri,

172
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:08,627
where tons of waste from the Manhattan project was

173
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,730
improperly stored, some near a creek

174
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,764
that winds through residential communities,

and people who live there have noticed some alarming trends.

00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,570
JENELL WRIGHT:<i> I got on Facebook  in order to reconnect</i>

177
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,305
<i>with people from high school...</i>

178
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,942
<i> And we all immediately  started noticing that so many</i>

179
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,245
<i> of us were sick.  We've discovered that</i>

180
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,080
<i> the Department  of Veterans Affairs</i>

181
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,785
<i>officially recognizes around 21 cancers associated with exposure</i>

182
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,621
<i> to ionizing radiation,  and compared that list</i>

183
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:37,288
<i> to what we had.</i>

184
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:40,693
<i> We had all of those cancers,  every single one.</i>

185
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,295
That is an incredibly depressing thing to discover

186
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,265
on Facebook and it's-- it's hard to know how to respond.

187
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,100
I mean, you definitely don't want to use

188
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,668
the "like" button, because...

189
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,804
then it looks like you really like the fact

190
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:52,737
they just got cancer.

191
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,074
Now, there is that new sad emoji,

192
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,441
which would really be perfect

193
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,709
if you hadn't already cheapened it by using it to respond

194
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,812
to the news that Chris Pratt and Anna Faris were separating.

195
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:05,918
I mean, it is sad. It is sad. But it is not "21-cancer" sad.

196
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:08,954
It's "nine-cancer" sad. Tops.

197
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,125
The point is, thankfully, 60 years ago,

198
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,427
our government and the scientific consensus

199
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,895
came up with a solution.

200
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:20,132
In 1957, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report

201
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,168
urging the creation of a permanent storage facility

202
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,971
deep underground. Basically, a nuclear toilet.

203
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,139
And while we did build a repository

204
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,175
for lower-level waste in New Mexico,

205
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:31,542
we still haven't built one

206
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,446
for the most dangerous, high-level waste.

207
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,548
And, as a result, it's essentially been left

208
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,850
wherever it was made. Which is not good,

209
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,985
because those facilities were not built

210
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,521
with the idea that they would be storing waste indefinitely.

211
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,957
So, to continue the toilet metaphor,

212
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,192
we've basically been shitting in bags,

213
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,861
leaving them all over the house,

214
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,596
and praying that they don't leak.

215
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:52,932
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

216
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,300
And the most frightening example of this is

217
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,401
the Hanford Site in Washington state,

218
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:59,603
which created two third of the plutonium

219
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:01,640
in the US arsenal and is currently storing

220
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,509
56 million gallons of highly toxic

221
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,211
and radioactive waste underground.

222
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:06,979
And over the years,

223
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,480
there have been so many issues at Hanford,

224
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:11,250
that they've achieved a dubious honor,

225
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,051
as one local new-station reported,

226
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,053

Right here!"

238
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,050
There have been a string of problems at Hanford,

239
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,685
from explosions, to toxic vapor releases,

240
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:49,387
to over a million gallons of waste

241
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,390
leaking out of their tanks over the years.

242
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,158
It has been so bad, the government has had

243
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,728
to pay out nearly one and a half billion dollars

244
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:58,663
in compensation to thousands of workers for illnesses

245
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,065
stemming from exposure to radiation

246
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:01,366
and toxic chemicals there.

247
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,501
A local news station has done a series of reports

248
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,071
on Hanford, and after a tunnel collapse this May,

249
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:08,573
they found some of the infrastructure there is

250
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:11,409
almost comically badly put together.

You can't build something out of wood and expect it

259

Hanford... Hanford is a gigantic problem.

263
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,845
And even though it hasn't produced anything for 30 years,

264
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,379
the Department of Energy still spends

265

nearly two and a half billion dollars a year

of its annual budget.

268
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,153

269
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,456
to find out that a place you just heard about

270

I don't live near Hanford,"

277
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:18,242
remember there are nuclear power plants storing waste

278
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,778
all over the country, lots of it in so-called

279
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,480
"spent fuel pools."

280
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,017
That's where nuclear fuel rods are supposed to be

281
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:26,784
temporarily placed to cool down,

282
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,886
and then put into dry containers,

283
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,054
and then moved

284
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,990
to permanent underground storage sites.

285
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,359
But remember, we don't have one of those.

286
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,394
And in many places those pools are just accumulating

287
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:38,663
more and more rods.

288
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,399
And while experts say it's highly unlikely,

289
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,836
if a Fukushima-like accident happens at one of those,

290
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,771
the results could be catastrophic.

a permanent facility to store our most dangerous waste.

308
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,916
And 30 years ago, we actually settled on a site,

309
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,817
Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

310
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,653
Congress passed a law designating it

as our sole candidate for waste storage.

Now since then, we've spent 15 billion dollars

00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,759
prepping the site,

314
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,062

So, Yucca mountain is our permanent storage site.

So the problem is solved, right? Well, no!

339
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:48,326
Because while the site has been deemed safe,

340
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:49,961
and the people in the immediate area,

341
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:52,397

342
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:54,131
many Nevadans elsewhere in the state

343
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:55,866
really don't want it.

344
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,336
And their former senator, Harry Reed, lobbied hard,

345

346
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:03,275

for all the states sitting on their nuclear waste,

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,611
but to put it mildly,

349
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,746
it was not exactly scientifically-sound.

350
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,915
Leave it on site, where it is.
