If you want to watch with subtitles, take your chosen subtitle .srt file from the

"Subtitles - Project Threepio" folder, copy it to the folder with the .mkv file and

rename the .srt file to the same name as the .mkv file, while keeping the .srt extension.


So for example, if you wanted to watch with Bulgarian subtitles, you would copy the file

"SW-bg-full.srt" from the "Subtitles - Project Threepio" folder to the folder with the

"Star.Wars.Despecialized.Edition.v2.5.mkv" file and rename the file to

"Star.Wars.Despecialized.Edition.v2.5.srt".
