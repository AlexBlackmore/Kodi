1
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:26,642
A long time ago in a galaxy far,
far away....

2
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:33,734
STAR
WARS

3
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:41,946
It is a period of civil war.

4
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:47,500
Rebel spaceships, striking from
a hidden base...

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,100
...have won their first victory
against the evil Galactic Empire.

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,772
During the battle, rebel spies
managed to steal...

7
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:07,100
...secret plans to the Empire’s ultimate
weapon, the DEATH STAR...

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,393
...an armored space station
with enough power...

9
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:16,647
...to destroy an entire planet.

10
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:21,319
Pursued by the Empire’s
sinister agents...

11
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:26,616
...Princess Leia races home
aboard her starship...

12
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:31,913
...custodian of the stolen plans
that can save her people...

13
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:37,220
...and restore freedom to the galaxy....

14
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,681
Going somewhere, Solo?

15
00:49:14,004 --> 00:49:18,480
It’s too late. You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

16
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:24,998
Jabba’s put a price on your head so large every
bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you...

17
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:27,098
I’m lucky I found you first.

18
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:33,164
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.

19
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,400
Jabba’s through with you.

20
00:49:39,395 --> 00:49:41,881
He has no time for smugglers...

21
00:49:42,031 --> 00:49:46,100
...who drop their shipments
at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.

22
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:52,568
You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.

23
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:56,178
That’s the idea.

24
00:49:56,428 --> 00:50:00,206
I’ve been looking forward to this for a long time.
