This is a reconstruction of the 1980 theatrical version of The Empire Strikes Back. The original shots were painstakingly restored using various sources (listed below) and the film received an extensive shot by shot colour correction.

The remastered version (v2.0) represents a significant improvement in picture quality over the earlier 1.0 version
due to the use of better encoding and higher quality sources and replacing many of the despecialized shots with
higher quality ones.

A gallery showing all the changes can be found here:

The MKV version contains a large number of audio tracks, including the latest versions of the preservations
of the original audio mixes in DTS-HD MA, three different commentary tracks, an isolated score and dubbing
tracks in 13 different languages.

         ***

If you want to watch with subtitles, take your chosen subtitle .srt file from the

"Subtitles - Project Threepio" folder, copy it to the folder with the .mkv file and

rename the .srt file to the same name as the .mkv file, while keeping the .srt extension.


So for example, if you wanted to watch with Bulgarian subtitles, you would copy the file

"ESB-bg-full.srt" from the "Subtitles - Project Threepio" folder to the folder with the

"The.Empire.Strikes.Back.Despecialized.Edition.v2.0.mkv" file and rename the file to

"The.Empire.Strikes.Back.Despecialized.Edition.v2.0.srt".
