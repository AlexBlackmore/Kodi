This is a reconstruction of the 1977 theatrical version of STAR WARS. The original shots were painstakingly restored using 
various sources (listed below) and the film received an extensive shot by shot colour correction based on a fade free 1977
I.B. Technicolor Print.

The remastered version (v2.0) represented a significant improvement in picture quality over the earlier version.

Version v2.1 further improved upon the previous version mainly by refining the colour correction but also by replacing many of the despecialized shots with higher quality ones.

Version v2.5 offers few more little tweaks to the picture and contains an unprecedented number of audio options, including lossless 
DTS-HD tracks for the original mixes (the original 70mm six-track was recreated by hairy_hen, the original stereo mix was captured
from LaserDisc PCM and fixed up by hairy_hen and the original mono mix was restored by Belbucus from a VHS recording), an isolated
score, four different commentary tracks, dubbing tracks in ten different languages and dialects and a British commentary
for visually impaired.

Unverified subtitles (may need significant improvements):

Mandarin (Simplified), American Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Korean, Turkish, Romanian, Croatian,

Greek, and Bulgarian.


All subtitles are from "Project Threepio v6.2"

More info here:

http://originaltrilogy.com/forum/topic.cfm/Project-Threepio-Star-Wars-OOT-subtitles/topic/13794/


If you want to watch with subtitles, take your chosen subtitle .srt file from the

"Subtitles - Project Threepio" folder, copy it to the folder with the .mkv file and

rename the .srt file to the same name as the .mkv file, while keeping the .srt extension.


So for example, if you wanted to watch with Bulgarian subtitles, you would copy the file

"SW-bg-full.srt" from the "Subtitles - Project Threepio" folder to the folder with the

"Star.Wars.Despecialized.Edition.v2.5.mkv" file and rename the file to

"Star.Wars.Despecialized.Edition.v2.5.srt".
